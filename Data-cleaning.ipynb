rendered on the cloud and streamed down to the ue the user wants to enjoy an immersive gaming experience which requires very high quality video eg k per eye at frames per second the cloud game server can only produce k video data due to hardware load and networking restrictions ai is used to upscale the k content into k content for a better user experience the following figure shows an example of such a network figure example dnnbased downupscaler the low resolution video is streamed to the ue which will process the video to infer the high resolution version the downsampling and upsampling parts of the network are matched to produce best results any updates to the downsampling part of network would require updates on the ueside to the upsampling part of the network in addition to the lr version of the video model weights and topology updates may need to be sent to the ue the pretrained models are optimized to the type of content eg sport cartoons movie and to the scale factor as the

thereby the degrees of freedom dof describe the number of independent parameters used to define movement of a viewport in the d space any consistent interaction for an xr application with xr hardware is assumed to be restricted to an xr session once an xr session has been successfully established it can be used to poll the viewer pose query information about the users environment and present imagery to the user figure different degrees of freedom for a user in extended realities typically the following different types of degreesoffreedom are described and also shown in figure dof three rotational and unlimited movements around the x y and z axes respectively pitch yaw and roll a typical use case is a user sitting in a chair looking at d vr content on an hmd see figure a dof dof with additional limited translational movements typically head movements along x y and z axes a typical use case is a user sitting in a chair looking at d vr content on an hmd with the capability to slightly move his head updown leftright and forwardbackward see figure b dof dof with full translational movements along x y and z axes beyond the dof experience it adds i moving up and down elevatingheaving ii moving left and right strafingswaying and iii moving forward and backward walkingsurging a typical use case is a user freely walking through d vr content physically or via dedicated user input means displayed on an hmd see figure d constrained dof dof with constrained translational movements along x y and z axes typically a couple of steps walking distance a typical use case is a user freely walking through vr content physically or via dedicated user input means displayed on an hmd but within a constrained walking area see figure c figure different degrees of freedom another term for constrained dof is room scale vr being a design paradigm for xr experiences which allows users to freely walk around a play area with their reallife motion reflected in the xr environment note constrained dof is not intended to describe multiroom spaces areas with uneven floor levels or very large open areas content that handles those scenarios is better categorized as unconstrained dof the degrees of freedom may also be used to describe the tracking capabilities of an xr device for more details on tracking refer to clauses and content and tracking capabilities of a device do not necessarily have to match however the user is preferably informed by the application on any differences between content and tracking capabilities in terms of numbertypes of degrees of freedom spaces provide a relation of the users physical environment with other tracked entities an xr space represents a virtual coordinate system with an origin that corresponds to a physical location the world coordinate system is the coordinate system in which the virtual world is created coordinate systems are essential for operating in dimensional virtual and real worlds for xr applications as an example a coordinate system is defined by openxr in clause as well as for webxr both using a cartesian righthanded coordinate system as shown in figure this coordinate system is righthanded in sense that where x is considered right y is considered up and z is considered forward a coordinate system is expected to be a rectangular cartesian in which all axes are equally scaled figure righthanded coordinate system a threedimensional vector is defined by the xyz coordinates if used to represent physical distances rather than eg velocity or angular velocity and not otherwise specified values are in meters a position in the xr space is a dvector representing a position within a space and relative to the origin an xr reference space is one of several common xr spaces that can be used to establish a spatial relationship with the users physical environment an xr reference space may be restricted determining the ability by the user to move this aligns with the definitions above as well as figure namely an xr reference space providing the degrees of freedom for a user for dof the xr reference space is limited to a single position for dof the xr reference space is limited to a small space centered around a single position a small bounding box limited to positions attainable with head movements only around a single position is provided for constrained dof the xr reference space has a native bounds geometry describing the border around the space which the user can expect to safely move within such borders may for example be described by polygonal boundary

with the views physical output properties including the field of view eye offset and other optical properties a view among others has associated a view offset describing a position and orientation of the view in the xr reference space an eye describing which eye this view is expected to be shown displays may support stereoscopic or monoscopic viewing an xr viewport describes a viewport or a rectangular region of a graphics surface the xr viewport corresponds to the projection of the xr view onto a target display an xr viewport is predominantly defined by the width and height of the rectangular dimensions of the viewport in d computer graphics the view frustum is the region of space in the modeled world that may appear on the screen ie it is the field of view of a perspective virtual camera system the planes that cut the frustum perpendicular to the viewing direction are called the near plane and the far plane objects closer to the camera than the near plane or beyond the far plane are not drawn sometimes the far plane is placed infinitely far away from the camera so all objects within the frustum are drawn regardless of their distance from the camera generally an xr pose describes a position and orientation in space relative to an xr space the position in the xr space is a dvector representing the position within a space and relative to the origin defined by the xyz coordinates if used to represent physical distances x y and z are in meters the orientation in the xr space is a quaternion representing the orientation within a space and defined by a fourdimensional or homogeneous vector with xyzw coordinates with w being the real part of the quarternion and x y and z the imaginary parts unit quaternions are used to document spatial rotations in three dimensions roll pitch and yaw as for example used in ts have limitationsfor example due to the wellknown gimbal lock hence in computer science engineering and xr applications they are replaced with the more robust quaternion an xr viewer pose is an xr pose describing the state of a viewer of the xr scene as tracked by the xr device xr viewer poses are documented relative to an xr reference

other old cn node by sending delete bearer request messages to that cn node when the timer started in step expires and if resources for indirect forwarding have been allocated then they are released --- the g system shall be able to support multicast communication between the ues within the group of ues using indirect network connection --- the warning message transmission function provides means to transfer warning message via s interface --- the ngran may be required to provide the ul andor dl qos flow congestion information to upf ie a percentage of congestion level for exposure the upf may be required to monitor and expose the ul andor dl qos flow congestion information reported from the ngran qos monitoring request for congestion information provided by the smf to the ngran is to trigger the ngran to measure and report ul andor dl qos flow congestion information to psa upf as defined in note how the ran measures and reports the congestion information is up to ran implementation note it is assumed that the ran reports whenever there is a change in the percentage of packets to be marked with ecn for ls marking andor congestion information the granularity of change in percentage determination is up to ran implementation for the reporting of the congestion information from psa upf the periodical reporting is not applied and only the reporting frequency event triggered applies see clause the psa upf shall send a report when the measurement result crosses the indicated reporting threshold subsequent reports shall not be sent by the psa upf during the minimum waiting time the psa upf reports the received ul andor dl qos flow congestion information to the target nf as instructed by the qos monitoring request see clause from the smf only one of ecn marking for ls in the case of ecn marking for ls in ran as described in clause or qos monitoring of congestion information may be requested to ngran for a qos flow they are mutually exclusive therefore measurements of congestion information on a qos flow are not provided in qos monitoring reports if smf enables ecn marking for ls in ran see clause --- rrcinactive is a state where a ue remains in cmconnected and can move within an area configured by ngran the rna without notifying ngran in rrcinactive the last serving gnb node keeps the ue context and the ueassociated ng connection with the serving amf and upf for a ue in rrcinactive with edrx cycle longer than seconds the ngran node may based on implementation send a request to the amf to perform mt communication handling as described in ts if the last serving gnb receives dl data from the upf or dl ueassociated signalling from the amf except the ue context release command message while the ue is in rrcinactive it pages in the cells corresponding to the rna and may send xnap ran paging to neighbour gnbs if the rna includes cells of neighbour gnbs upon receiving the ran paging request message from the amf while the ue is in rrcinactive with edrx beyond seconds the last serving gnb may page in its cells comprised in the rna and may send xnap ran paging to neighbour gnbs if the rna includes cells of neighbour gnbs in order for the gnb to trigger the ue to resume connection in rrcconnected state or rrcinactive state upon receiving the ue context release command message while the ue is in rrcinactive the last serving gnb may page in the cells corresponding to the rna and may send xnap ran paging to neighbour gnbs if the rna includes cells of neighbour gnbs in order to release ue explicitly upon receiving the ng reset message while the ue is in rrcinactive the last serving gnb may page involved ues in the cells corresponding to the rna and may send xnap ran paging to neighbour gnbs if the rna includes cells of neighbour gnbs in order to explicitly release involved ues upon ran paging failure the gnb behaves according to ts the amf provides to the ngran node the core network assistance information to assist the ngran nodes decision whether the ue can be sent to rrcinactive and to assist ue configuration and paging in rrcinactive the core network assistance information includes the registration area configured for the ue the periodic registration update timer and the ue identity index value and may include the ue specific drx an indication if the ue is configured with mobile initiated connection only mico mode by the amf the expected ue behaviour the ue radio capability for paging the pei with paging subgrouping assistance information the nr paging edrx information the paging cause indication for voice service the hashed ue identity index value and the cn support indication for mt communication handling the ue registration area is taken into account by the ngran node when configuring the rna the ue specific drx and ue identity index value are used by the ngran node for ran paging the periodic registration update timer is taken into account by the ngran node to configure periodic rna update timer the ngran node takes into account the expected ue behaviour to assist the ue rrc state transition decision the ngran node may use the ue radio capability for paging during ran paging the ngran node takes into account the pei with paging subgrouping assistance information for subgroup paging in rrcinactive except when the ue context contains an emergency pdu session in which case the pei with paging subgrouping assistance information shall not be used according to ts when sending the xnap ran paging to neighbour ngran nodes the pei with paging subgrouping assistance information may be included the ngran node takes into account the nr paging edrx information to configure the ran paging when the nr ue is in rrcinactive when sending xnap ran paging to neighbour ngran nodes the nr paging edrx information for rrcidle and for rrcinactive may be included the ngran node takes into consideration the paging cause indication for voice service to include the paging cause in ran paging for a ue in rrcinactive state when sending xnap ran paging to neighbour ngran nodes the paging cause may be included when sending xnap ran paging to neighbour ngran nodes the hashed ue identity index value may be included to determine the start point of ptw the ngran takes into account the cn support indication for mt communication handling when deciding to request the amf for mt communication handling for a ue in rrcinactive state with long edrx beyond seconds as described in ts at transition to rrcinactive the ngran node may configure the ue with a periodic rna update timer value at periodic rna update timer expiry without notification from the ue the gnb behaves as specified in ts if the ue accesses a gnb other than the last serving gnb the receiving gnb triggers the xnap retrieve ue context procedure to get the ue context from the last serving gnb and may also trigger an xnu address indication procedure including tunnel information for potential recovery of data from the last serving gnb upon successful ue context retrieval the receiving gnb shall perform the sliceaware admission control in case of receiving slice information and becomes the serving gnb and it further triggers the ngap path switch request and applicable rrc procedures after the path switch procedure the serving gnb triggers release of the ue context at the last serving gnb by means of the xnap ue context release procedure in case the ue is not reachable at the last serving gnb the gnb shall fail any amf initiated ueassociated class procedure which allows the signalling of unsuccessful operation in the respective response message it may trigger the nas non delivery indication procedure to report the nondelivery of any non pdu session related nas pdu received from the amf as specified in ts if the ue accesses a gnb other than the last serving gnb and the receiving gnb does not find a valid ue context the receiving gnb can perform establishment of a new rrc connection instead of resumption of the previous rrc connection ue context retrieval will also fail and hence a new rrc connection needs to be established if the serving amf changes a ue in the rrcinactive state is required to initiate rna update procedure when it moves out of the configured rna when receiving rna update request from the ue the receiving gnb triggers the xnap retrieve ue context procedure to get the ue context from the last serving gnb and may decide to send the ue back to rrcinactive state move the ue into rrcconnected state or send the ue to rrcidle in case of periodic rna update if the last serving gnb decides not to relocate the ue context it fails the retrieve ue context procedure and sends the ue back to rrcinactive or to rrcidle directly by an encapsulated rrcrelease message --- figure resource status reporting successful operation the enb shall report the results of the admitted measurements in resource status update message the admitted measurements are the measurements that were successfully initiated during the preceding resource status reporting initiation procedure and thus not reported in the measurement failed report characteristics ie for the concerned cell in the resource status response message if the enb receives the resource status update message which includes the ue id ie in the rsrp measurement report list ie the enb may use the ue id ie to link the associated rsrp measurement report with other measurement results eg csi reports rsrp measurement reports of the same ue if the csi report ie including the csi process configuration index ie is received enb shall interpret this ie as an index identifying one of the csi process configurations that can be configured for all ues within the cell where the csi measurements were collected for all ues within the cell the maximum number of csi process configurations is given by the maximum value of the csi process configuration index ie if the enb receives the resource status update message which includes the cell reporting indicator ie set to stop request in one or more items of the cell measurement result ie the enb should initialise the resource status reporting initiation procedure to remove all or some of the corresponding cells from the measurement --- request to send a facility message for the provision of a call independent supplementary

an unnecessarily complex technical solution the required technical and legal operations necessary for exchanging traffic with another operator should be as easy and straightforward as possible b compatibility with existing standards unless there are explicit requirements why existing pki standards should be extended to accommodate gpp environment the gpp specifications should be accommodated to the existing standards this allows best choice of equipment for operators and allows interoperability with nongpp environments c usable by both grx and nongrx operators both operators making use of grx providers and those without using leased lines or even the public internet should be able to make use of ndsaf measures to exchange traffic securely --- this specification introduces an additional

server needs to support privacy either inherently eg in tls or via separate privacy option eg in tls if privacy is an option in tls layer then the operator needs to configure ue with the information that privacyontls layer is enabled further following considerations need to be taken in step of figure b it is important that calculation of suci which is sent in nas layer is done using schemes other than nullscheme otherwise the subscription identifier protection provided by tls layer becomes ineffective privacywise nevertheless the nullscheme could be used in nas layer while still preserving subscription identifier privacy by omitting the username part from nai as described in rfc clause y it would be analogous to using anonymous identifier in eap meaning that only realm part from nai is included in suci which is sent in nas layer thus formed suci can still be used to route the authentication request to ausf in step and of figure b when tls is used the ue would need to behave as described in section privacy of rfc where instead of sending the client certificate in cleartext over the air the ue first sends tls certificate no cert and only later sends tls certificate after a tls is setup --- mcxa user authentication and authorization interoperability between different networks and different manufacturers clients and servers shall satisfy the requirements for mission

different qos flows or based on the downlink data service information ie note the end marker packet is not considered as dl data packet so that it does not trigger the up function to notify the cp function about the arrival of a dl packet the up function can discard the received end marker packets silently when it is not possible to be forwarded if the up function indicated support of header enrichment of ul traffic see clause the cp function may provide the up function with header enrichment information for uplink traffic by including one or more header enrichment ies in the far in this case the up function should use this information to enrich the header of the uplink traffic eg http header enrichment note it is not defined how to support sgi ptp tunnelling mechanisms other than based on udpip encapsulation such as pmipvgre ltp gtpcu see clause of gpp ts for nonip pdn connections if the up function indicated support of pdi optimisation see clause the cp function may include in the forwarding parameters of the far the linked traffic endpoint id if it is available identifying the traffic endpoint allocated for this pfcp session to receive the traffic in the reverse direction note this information can enable an sgwu or pgwu to correlate the ul and dl traffic ie pdrs sent over a same bearer assuming for instance a pfcp session provisioned in a pgwu with an ul pdr for an ss bearer with source interface access associated to an ul traffic endpoint id comprising the ip address a local teid and optionally a network instance a dl pdr with source interface core ue ip address and sdf the cp function sets the linked traffic endpoint in the dl far associated to dl pdr to the ul traffic endpoint which allows the pgwu to correlate the uplink and downlink pdrs for the same bearer ie that ul pdr associated to ul traffic endpoint and dl pdr associated to dl far with linked traffic endpoint set to ul traffic endpoint use the same ss bearer note the linked traffic endpoint can possibly refer to a traffic endpoint in the reverse direction requested to be created in the same pfcp request --- upon receiving a sip message request containing an acceptcontact header

this subclause apply for requests received at the icscf when the topmost route header field of the request contains the orig parameter the icscf shall verify for all requests whether they arrived from a trusted domain or not if the request arrived from a non trusted domain then the icscf shall respond with forbidden response if the request arrived from a trusted domain the icscf shall perform the procedures below note the icscf can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted domain or not from the procedures described in gpp ts a for all sip transactions identified if priority is supported as containing an authorised resourcepriority header field or if such an option is supported relating to a dialog which previously contained an authorised resourcepriority header field the icscf shall give priority over other transactions or dialogs this allows special treatment of such transactions or dialogs if priority is supported the icscf shall adjust the priority treatment of transactions or dialogs according to the most recently received authorized resourcepriority header field or backwards indication value note the special treatment can include filtering higher priority processing routeing call gapping the exact meaning of priority is not defined further in this document but is left to national regulation and network configuration if the icscf receives the pprofilekey header field in a sip request or response the icscf shall discard the pprofilekey header field when the icscf receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction the icscf will start the user location query procedure to the hss as specified in gpp ts for the calling user indicated in either the pserveduser header field if included in the request or the passertedidentity header field if the pserveduser header field is not included in the request prior to performing the user location query procedure to the hss the icscf decides which hss to query possibly as a result of a query to the subscription locator functional entity as specified in gpp ts when the icscf receives an invite request the icscf may require the periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the icscf if the icscf requires the session to be refreshed the icscf shall apply the procedures described in rfc clause note requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least one of the ues this functionality cannot automatically be granted ie at least one of the involved ues needs to support it when the response for user location query contains information about the required scscf capabilities the icscf shall select a scscf according to the method described in gpp ts if the user location query was successful the icscf shall insert the of an as hosting the psi or

the hss group id using the form aaahssgcgidgidinvalid if the hss group id is received following procedures in clause x if a wildcarded identity value is received from the hss in the wildcardedidentity and the icscf supports the sip pprofilekey private header extension include the wildcarded public user identity value in the pprofilekey header field as defined in rfc and forward the request based on the topmost route header field note the puserdatabase header field can be included only if the icscf can assume eg based on local configuration that the receiving scscf will be able to process the header field upon an unsuccessful user location query the icscf shall return an appropriate unsuccessful sip response this response may be a not found response or does not exist anywhere response in the case the user is not a user of the home network when the icscf receives any response to the above request and forwards it to as the icscf shall store the values from the pchargingfunctionaddresses header field if present if the next hop is outside of the current network then the icscf shall remove the pchargingfunctionaddresses header field prior to forwarding the message and insert a pchargingvector header field containing the type origioi header field parameter if received in the request and a type termioi header field parameter in the response the icscf shall set the type termioi header field parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the response and the type origioi header field parameter is set to the previously received value of type origioi header field parameter --- the following clause specifies per operation type the charging data that are sent by mms node for mms converged charging the operation types are listed in the following order i initialt terminatione event therefore when all operation types are possible it is marked as ite if only some operation types are allowed for a node only the appropriate letters are used ie it or e as

type access technology selected utran eutran implementation optional this command is only applicable to ues in utran and eutran --- this subclause does not reflect dynamic conformance requirements but static ones in particular a condition for support of a pdu parameter does not reflect requirements about the syntax of the pdu ie the presence of a parameter but the capability of the implementation to support the parameter in the sending direction the support of a parameter means that the implementation is able to send this parameter but it does not mean that the implementation always sends it in the receiving direction it means that the implementation supports the whole semantic of the parameter that is described in the main part of this specification as a consequence pdu parameter tables in this subclause are not the same as the tables describing the syntax of a pdu in the reference specification eg rfc tables and it is not rare to see a parameter which is optional in the syntax but mandatory in subclause below the various statii used in this subclause are in accordance with the rules in table a table a key to status codes in the context of this specification the i status code mandates that the implementation does not change the content of the parameter it is an implementation option if the implementation acts upon the content of the parameter eg by setting filter criteria to known or unknown parts of parameters in order to find out the route a message has to take it must be understood that this gpp sip profile does not list all parameters which an implementation will treat as indicated by the status code irrelevant in general an implementation will pass on all unknown messages header fields and header field parameters as long as it can perform its normal behaviour the following additional comments apply to the interpretation of the tables in this annex note the tables are constructed according to the conventional rules for ics proformas and profile tables note the notation either directly or as part of a conditional of m for the sending of a parameter and i for the receipt of the same parameter may be taken as indicating that the parameter is passed on transparently ie without modification where a conditional applies this behaviour only applies when the conditional is met as an example the profile for the mgcf is found by first referring to clause which states the mgcf shall provide the ua role profiles are divided at the top level into the two roles in table a user agent and proxy the ua role is defined in subclause a and the proxy role is defined in subclause a more specific roles are listed in table a table aa table ab and table ac the mgcf role is item in table a the mgcf role is not found in table aa or table ab therefore all profile entries for the mgcf are found by searching for a in subclause a as a further example to look up support of the reason header field table a item lists the resaon header field as a major capability that is optional for the user agent role a subsequent search for a in subclause a shows that the reason header field is optional for a user agent role to send and receive for ack bye cancel invite message notify options prack publish refer register subscribe and update requests also table a item lists the reason header field as a major capability that is optional for the proxy role a subsequent search for a in subclause a shows that if supported the reason header field is mandatory to send and irrelevant to receive for ack bye cancel invite message notify options prack publish refer register subscribe and update requests --- upon receiving a sip bye request for releasing the prearranged mcvideo group call the mcvideo client shall follow the procedures as specified in clause

nonce that is deemed valid by the scscf for the related registration or registration flow ie a nonce that was set in a a proxyauthenticate header field of a proxy authentication required response to a nonregister request for which the associated validity duration has not expired or in a authenticate header field of a unauthorized response to a register request for which the associated validity duration has not expired a nonce sent in a nextnonce header field parameter sent in a authenticationinfo header field of a ok ok to register request or if an authentication is ongoing for this request ie a associated reqawaitauth is running matching the nonce that was sent in a proxyauthenticate header field of the proxy authentication required response to this request note the related registration flow or registration is identified by the couple instanceid and regid if the multiple registration mechanism is used or by contact address if not a uri header field parameter matching the sip request a cnonce header field parameter and a nc header field parameter with a value that equals the noncecount expected by the scscf the scscf may choose to accept a noncecount which is greater than the expected noncecount if the scscf uses this noncecount and authentication is successful and the scscf increments it for any subsequent authentication responses if any of the above checks do not succeed the scscf shall proceed as described in subclause and skip the remainder of this procedure and b check whether the received authentication challenge response and the expected authentication challenge response match the scscf shall compute the expected digest response as described in rfc and rfc using the ha value contained within the authentication vector and other digest parameters ie nonce

following rechallenge the user by issuing a proxy authentication required response including a challenge as per procedures described in this subclause or reject the request by issuing a forbidden response or reject the request without sending a response in the case where the digest response matches the expected digest response calculated by the scscf the scscf shall consider the identity of the user verified and the request authenticated and continue with the procedures as described in subclause if the used nonce was not considered valid before the authentication succed ie a reqawaitauth was running add this nonce to the list of the valid nonces for the related registration or registration flow if multiple registration mechanism is used for an operator configured duration and stop the

account from the r there is a condition for the vn when n is used there is a full mesh of n tunnels between upfs serving the g vn group when there are multiple smfsupfs if the full mesh mechanism is used there are more cuplane connections eg there are m smfs and n upfs with the full mesh topology the signalling connection between smfs is m m number of n tunnels is n n from the following figure when the number of node eg smfupf exceeds the star topology has more advantages figure so there is a need to reduce the number of interfaces from the square of the number of nodes to a linear

resources towards source bss by performing the bss packet flow delete procedure the ue initiates a tracking area update procedure when one of the conditions listed in clause triggers for tracking area update applies the target mme knows that an irat handover has been performed for this ue as it received the bearer contexts by handover messages and therefore the target mme performs only a subset of the ta update procedure specifically it excludes the context transfer procedures between source sgsn and target mme if the subscription data received from the hss during the tau in step contains information that is necessary for the eutran to be aware of eg a restriction in the ues permission to use nr as a secondary rat unlicensed spectrum in the form of laalwalwipnru as specified in clause or a combination of them or an existing ue context in the mme indicates that the ue is not permitted to use nr as a secondary rat unlicensed spectrum or a combination of them and the mme has not provided this information to the target enodeb during step of the handover preparation phase then the mme sends an updated handover restriction list in the downlink nas transport message that it sends to eutran if the ue is not allowed to use nr as secondary rat the mme indicates that to the ue in tau accept message when the timer at the source sgsn started in step expires and if the source sgsn received the serving gw change indication in the forward relocation response message it deletes the eps bearer resources by sending delete session request cause operation indication messages to the source serving gw the operation indication flag is not set that indicates to the source serving gw that the source serving gw shall not initiate a delete procedure towards the pdn gw the source serving gw acknowledges with delete session response cause messages if isr has been activated before this procedure the cause indicates to the source sgw that the source sgw shall delete the bearer resources on the other old cn node by sending delete bearer request messages to that cn node if indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at source sgsn started at step triggers the source sgsn to send a delete indirect data forwarding tunnel request message to the sgw to release the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding if indirect forwarding was used and the serving gw is relocated then the expiry of the timer at target mme started at step triggers the target mme to send a delete indirect data forwarding tunnel request message to the target sgw to release

performs registration procedures towards the gs to establish the necessary resources over the uuinterface note for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay the gc can provide the service continuity for the remote mc service ue with the ues original ip address as described in gpp ts the mc service client receives the mc service communication over a unicast pdu session optionally the mc service server may send the mbs session announcement to the remote mc service client with the information of the mbs session note the information of the mbs session can be available at the remote mc service client due to a previous mc service signalling via the relay ue a if a multicast mbs session has been announced the mc service ue performs a ue session join towards the gc using the mbs session information and the mc service client may send a ue session join notification towards the server b if a broadcast mbs session has been announced the mc service client start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast mbs session the mc service client sends an mbs listening status report which indicates the mbs reception quality associated with the mbs session id is sufficient to receive media note it is implementation specific whether the mbs session reception quality level is determined per mbs session per media stream or per mbs qos flow level via eg measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the ngran nodes packet loss based on the report received from mc service client in step the mc service server determines to stop sending the mc service

pdn connection establishment in epc the smfpgwc selects an snssai associated with the pdn connection as described in clause if the selected snssai by the smfpgwc is subject to the nsac the smfpgwc triggers interaction with nsacf to check the availability of the network slice by invoking separate nsac procedures for number of ue and number of pdu session as described in clause of ts before the smfpgwc provides the selected snssai to the ue if the network slice is available the smfpgwc continues to proceed with the pdn connection establishment procedure the nsacf performs the following for checking network slice availability prior to returning a response to the smfpgwc for nsac for number of ues if the ue identity is already included in the list of ue ids registered with a network slice or the ue identity is not included in the list of ue ids registered with a network slice and the current number of ue registration did not reach the maximum number the nsacf responds to the smfpgwc with the information that the network slice is available the nsacf includes the ue identity in the list of ue ids if not already on the list and increases the current number of ue registration otherwise the nsacf returns a response indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been reached if hierarchical nsac architecture is deployed when the local maximum number or local

nsacf see clause if the maximum number of ues andor the maximum number of pdu sessions has already been reached unless operator policy implements a different action the smfpgwc rejects the pdn connection note as an implementation option if the apn is mapped to more than one snssai and the first selected snssai is not available eg either current number of ue registration reached maximum or current number of pdu sessions reached maximum then based on the operator policy the pgwcsmf can try another mapped snssai for the pdn connection establishment procedure if the establishment of a new pdn connections is with a different smfpgwc from the smfpgwc used for already existing pdn connection associated with the same snssai each smfpgwc will send a request for update eg increase or decrease to the nsacf the nsacf may maintain a registration entry per smfpgwc for the same ue id the smfpgwc provides the access type to the nsacf when triggering a request to increase or decrease the number of ues andor the number of pdu sessions for an snssai note the smfpgwc determines the access type based on the rat type parameter in the pmip or gtp message received from the epdg or alternatively it can internally determine the access type based on the source node eg sgw sending the request for the pdn connection establishment when the ue with ongoing pdn connections moves from epc to gc the smfpgwc triggers a request to decrease the number of the ue registration in nsacf and the amf triggers a request to increase the number of the ue registration in nsacf when the ue is registered in the new amf if there are more than one pdn connections associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc the smfpgwc triggers a request to increase the number of the ue registration in nsacf and the old amf triggers a request to decrease the number of the ue registration in nsacf when the ue is deregistered in old amf if there are more than one pdu sessions associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs the nsacf maintains a list of ue ids based on the requests from smfpgwcs and amf and adjusts the current number of registrations accordingly when eps counting is performed for a network slice and the ue with ongoing pdn connections moves from epc to gc session continuity is guaranteed from nsac standpoint as the admission was granted at the time of pdn connection establishment ie the number of pdu session is not counted again in gc similarly when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc session continuity is guaranteed from nsac standpoint as the admission of the pdn connections to the network slice was already granted at the time of pdu session establishment in gc if the pdn connection associated with snssai is released in epc the smfpgwc triggers a request ie decrease to nsacf for maximum number of ues andor maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice control the nsacf decreases the current number of registrations and removes the ue identity from the list of ue ids if the pdn connections associated with the snssai are all released in epc note nsac in epc is not performed for the attachment without pdn connectivity if eps counting is not required for a network slice the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice is performed when the ue moves from epc to gc ie when the ue performs mobility registration procedure from epc to gc nsac for maximum number of ues per network slice andor when the pdn connections are handed over from epc to gc nsac for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice the smfpgwc is configured with the information indicating the network slice is subject to nsac only in gs the pdn connection interworking procedure is performed as described in clause mobility from epc to gc does not guarantee all active pdu sessions can be transferred to the gc in certain circumstances when either the current number of ue registration or the current number of pdu sessions would exceed the maximum number when the ue moves from epc to gc when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc the smfpgwc triggers a request to decrease the number of pdu session to nsacf if there are more than one pdu sessions associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs and nsacf removes the pdu session ids while decreasing the number of pdu sessions note given that session continuity is not guaranteed when eps counting is not required it is recommended for services which require the session continuity to support eps counting note when multiple nsacfs are deployed and if the number of ue in target nsacf has reached the maximum number whether session continuity can be guaranteed is left to implementation note when a centralized architecture is deployed ue admission is guaranteed at intersystem and interamf mobility if the same nsacf is selected this is the case for nonroaming scenarios and for roaming scenarios with hplmn nsac admission mode described in clause --- figure illustrates the network slice fault management process to address the key issue of network slice fault

communication environmental equipment processing error qos for deviceresourcefilefunctionalitysmallest nsce server may request the alarm information eg the gs network is not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the services problem collected by nsce client if possible the information collected by the nsce client depends on the thirdparties requirements and implementation nsce client report the requested fault information to nsce server nsce server correlates the applications services and the network resources of the specific network slice instances which supports the applications and services with the snssai nsi id nsinstanceid defined in ts application identifier defined in and then diagnoses the causes of the fault of the applications or services by analysing the fault information from different sources for example the ran function of the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application for a certain time duration the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by service availability failure events and in the ran function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time duration then the environment fault may be the root cause of the service availability failure and should be prioritized to be solved the fault may be identified with critical major minor ignore to show its prioritization nsce server response to val server with the reports of fault diagnostic result to indicate the causes of the failures of the applications or services if there is no problem within the gs network the val server may be requested to check the application layer itself again if the nsce server detects that the applicationservice error is caused by the gs the val server may send the fault diagnosis report to oam system to indicate the server fault which causes the applicationservice failure by utilizing the nsceoam interface note the apis utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to oam will reutilize the fault management services in ts exposed by egmf as defined in ts --- the request type in step indicates existing pdu session or existing emergency pdu session the smf determines that the request is due to switching between gpp access and nongpp access or due to handover from eps the smf identifies the existing pdu session based on the pdu session id in such a case the smf does not create a new sm context but instead updates the existing sm context and provides the representation of the updated sm context to the amf in the response if the request type is initial request and if the old pdu session id is included in nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext request the smf identifies the existing pdu session to be released based on the old pdu session id subscription data includes the allowed pdu session types allowed ssc modes default qi and arp subscribed sessionambr smfassociated external parameters ip index or static ip addressprefix may be included in the subscription data if the ue has subscribed to it the smf checks the validity of the ue request it checks whether the ue request is compliant with the user subscription and with local policies if the selected dnn corresponds to an ladn whether the ue is located within the ladn service area based on the ue presence in ladn service area indication from the amf if the amf does not provide the ue presence in ladn service area indication and the smf determines that the selected dnn corresponds to a ladn then the smf considers that the ue is out of the ladn service area the smf determines whether the pdu session requires redundancy and the smf determines the rsn as described in clause of ts if the smf determines that redundant handling is not allowed or not possible for the given pdu session the smf shall either reject the establishment of the pdu session or accept the establishment of a pdu session without redundancy handling based on local policy if the ue request is considered as not valid the smf decides to not accept to establish the pdu session note the smf can instead of the nudmsdmget service operation use the nudmsdmsubscribe service operation with an immediate report indication that triggers the udm to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the smf and the udm for a disaster roaming service the udm provides the session management subscription data to the smf based on the local policy andor the local configuration as specified in clause of ts for an snssai subject to nsac and if lbo applies the smf in supporting vplmn stores the applicable nsac admission mode from smf to amf either nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext response cause sm context id or n sm container pdu session reject cause or an nsmfpdusessionupdatesmcontext response depending on the request received in step if the smf received nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext request in step and the smf is able to process the pdu session establishment request the smf creates an sm context and responds to the amf by providing an sm context id if the up security policy for the pdu session is determined to have integrity protection set to required the smf may based on local configuration decide whether to accept or reject the pdu session request based on the ue integrity protection maximum data rate note the smf can eg be configured to reject a pdu session if the ue integrity protection maximum data rate has a very low value if the services provided by the dn would require higher bitrates when the smf decides to not accept to establish a pdu session the smf rejects the ue request via nas sm signalling including a relevant sm rejection cause by responding to the amf with nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext response the smf also indicates to the amf that the pdu session id is to be considered as released the smf proceeds to step and the pdu session establishment procedure is stopped optional secondary

during the sm policy association establishment procedure if the pcf detects the request relates to sm policy association enabling integration with tsn or tsc or deterministic networking as defined in ts clause based on local configuration the pcf may provide policy control request trigger for gs bridgerouter information as defined in clause of ts the pcf based on the emergency dnn sets the arp of the pcc rules to a value that is reserved for emergency services as described in ts note the purpose of step is to receive pcc rules before selecting upf if pcc rules are not needed as input for upf selection step can be performed after step during the sm policy association establishment procedure for a nonroaming pdu session if a snssai is subject to network slice usage control the pcf may provide a slice usage policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a pdu session inactivity timer value as described in clause of ts if the request type in step indicates initial request the smf selects an ssc mode for the pdu session as described in clause of ts the smf also selects one or more upfs as needed as described in clause of ts in the case of pdu session type ipv or ipv or ipvv the smf allocates an ip addressprefix for the pdu session unless configured otherwise as described in clause of ts in the case of pdu session type ipv or ipvv the smf also allocates an interface identifier to the ue for the ue to build its linklocal address for unstructured pdu session type the smf may allocate an ipv prefix for the pdu session and n pointtopoint tunnelling based on udpipv as described in clause of ts for ethernet pdu session type neither a mac nor an ip address is allocated by the smf to the ue for this pdu session if the amf indicated control plane ciot gs optimisation in step for this pdu session then for unstructured pdu session type the smf checks whether ues subscription include a nef identity for nidd for the dnnsnssai combination when the nef identity for nidd is present in the ues subscription data the smf will select the nef identified for the snssai and selected dnn in the nef identity for nidd as the anchor of this pdu session otherwise the smf will select a upf as the anchor of this pdu session for other pdu session types the smf will perform upf selection to select a upf as the anchor of this pdu session if the request type in step is existing pdu session the smf maintains the same ip addressprefix that has already been allocated to the ue in the source network if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session referring to an existing pdu session moved between gpp access and nongpp access the smf maintains the ssc mode of the pdu session the current pdu session anchor and ip address note the smf may decide to trigger eg new intermediate upf insertion or allocation of a new upf as described in step in clause if the request type indicates emergency request the smf selects the upf as described in clause of ts and selects ssc mode smf may select a upf eg based on requested dnnsnssai that supports nwtt functionality smf may select a psa upf that supports pdu set identification

policy control request trigger conditions that have been met if request type is initial request and dynamic pcc is deployed and pdu session type is ipv or ipv or ipvv smf notifies the pcf if the policy control request trigger condition is met with the allocated ue ip addressprefixes note if an ip addressprefix has been allocated before step eg subscribed static ip addressprefix in udmudr or the step is performed after step the ip addressprefix can be provided to pcf in step and the ip addressprefix notification in this step can be skipped pcf may provide updated policies to the smf the pcf may provide policy information defined in clause and in ts to smf the pcf for pdu session may generate pcc rule based on the ursp rule eg connection capability referring to the clause in ts note mapping between connection capability and sdf templates in the pcc rule is implementation specific if request type indicates initial request the smf initiates an n session establishment procedure with the selected upfs otherwise it initiates an n session modification procedure with the selected upfs a the smf sends an n session establishmentmodification request to the upf and provides packet detection enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the upf for this pdu session if the smf is configured to request ip address allocation from upf as described in clause of ts then the smf indicates to the upf to perform the ip addressprefix allocation and includes the information required for the upf to perform the allocation if the selective user plane deactivation is required for this pdu session the smf determines the inactivity timer and provides it to the upf for a pdu session for nonroaming subscribers if the snssai of the pdu session is subject to network slice usage control the smf obtains the pdu session inactivity timer value for the pdu session as described in step or step or uses preconfigured value and configures the upf to run the pdu session inactivity

subset of the requested nssai that is allowed by the subscribed snssais based on the list of supported tas and the corresponding list of supported slices for each ta obtained in n interface management procedures as specified in ts to determine the target niwf the amf may take into account ue location corresponding to last visited tai included in registration request as described at step when the ue

aggregates figure depicts the procedure for the roaming and nonroaming cases figure ueinitiated resource requestrelease with sa or sc the optional interaction steps between the gateways and the pcrf in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway both the roaming figure and nonroaming figure scenarios are depicted in the figure in the roaming case the vpcrf acts as an intermediary sending the qos policy rules provision from the hpcrf in the hplmn to the trusted nongpp ip access in the vplmn the vpcrf receives the acknowledgment from the trusted nongpp ip access and forwards it to the hpcrf in the nonroaming case the vpcrf is not involved at all the trusted nongpp ip access receives an ipcan specific resource allocation or resource release request initiated by the ue the trusted nongpp ip access initiates the gateway control and qos policy rules request procedure as specified in ts the trusted nongpp ip access provides the ue request or release of resources as an event report the pcrf makes a pcc decision as a result of the gateway control and qos policy request and provides the updated qos rules to the trusted nongpp ip access an ipcan specific resource allocation or resource release procedure may be triggered by the enforcement of the received policy rules in this step a response for the resource requestrelease is sent to the ue the trusted nongpp ip access indicates to the pcrf whether the requested qos policy rules provision could be enforced or not and thus completing the gw control and qos rules provision procedure the pcrf initiates the policy and charging rules provision procedure as specified in ts to update the pcc rules in the pdn gw the updated pcc rules and event triggers include any adjustments to resources due to the decision taken in step note step may be performed in parallel with steps if acknowledgement of resource allocation is not required at the pcrf to update pcc rules in pcef for details please refer to ts step may be omitted if the trusted nongpp ip access has already received authorisation for the ues request from the pcrf

in gc note the hss may be aware that a g subscription for the ue exists based on the core network type restrictions defined for the ue ie if restriction for core network type indicates that the ue can access to gc it implies that the ue has g subscription data additionally the hss may be aware that a ue for which g subscription data exist is not active in gc eg when the hss has not yet received an nhssuecm snderegistration request from the udm for that ue see clause step --- the complexity of operating a network increases with the number of supported subscribers and one contributor will be the management of allocating subscribers to the application servers for the same set of services where there is a requirement for a user to be assigned to an application servers longer than the duration

the parameters included in the request are defined in clause of ts the nf can request statistics or predictions or both the consumer provides the tais or cell ids andor finer granularity area eg below cell via longitudelatitude range etc in location information when requesting qos sustainability analytics if the af doesnt provide tais or cell ids the nwdaf as an gc internal nf is expected to obtain such information ie to determine which cells are related to the finer granularity area the consumer may optionally provide ue context or subscription information such as one or more of the following device speed or speed range serving upf node information subscriber category as in ts clause device model device manufacturer imei or imeisv or tac range supported frequency bands equipment type a if the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested analytics the nwdaf decides the amfs based on the taiscell ids and obtains the ue list in the tascells from amf by invoking namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation using event id number of ues present in a geographical area as described in ts b the nwdaf invokes namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the update of the ue list using event id ue moving in or out of area of interest as described in ts the nwdaf initiates the lcs service request to the gmlclmf to get the location and optionally the speed of ues from ue list provided by the amf in step the gmlclmf initiates the ue location service procedure and gets the location of the ues the gmlclmf provides location information for each ue in the ue list to the nwdaf from the list of ue locations returned by the gmlclmf the nwdaf identifies the ues located in finer granularity area by comparing the ues locations to the finer granularity area provided in step the nwdaf invokes namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the serving smf for the ue based on the serving smf in step the nwdaf invokes nsmfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the upf information for the ue the nwdaf may collect qos information either from the upf directly or subscribe to the upf via the smf the qos information may include the bandwidth packet delay for the ue and the information on the serving upf node id optionally the nwdaf may collect additional information for the ue context or ue subscription from the udm such as subscriber category pei if available pei may be used to retrieve from gsma database additional information such as device model device manufacturer imei or imeisv or tac range supported frequency bands equipment type such additional information may be used by nwdaf to add more information to the collected measurements and filter those measurements that are applicable to the ue and subscription context for which analytics are requested by the service consumer the nwdaf verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives the requested analytics the nwdaf can detect the need for notification based on comparing the requested analytics of the target qi against the reporting thresholds provided by the consumer in any cell over the requested analytics target period the nwdaf provides the response or notification on qos sustainability to the nf consumer note nwdaf may decide to ignore some of the filters if collected measurements are not sufficient to derive meaningful analytics in such scenario a warning message is provided in the response or notification to the nf consumer note in order to reduce the amount of information collected per measurement point the additional information from udm may only be collected for the events of gbr unfulfillment in this way the additional analytics filter information may only be supported for qi of resource type gbr and for events of gbr unfulfillment --- this solution addresses key issue --- in this scenario consider two separate gpp networks one gpp network with a satellite iot access network and satellite nr access network another gpp network with a terrestrial access network both networks have their own plmn id and have a roaming agreement in place with each other roaming is used by the terrestrial operator to use the

unit of this kpi is userj c d networkslice --- editors note key issue to cover study objective of identifying the appropriate network slice for outbound m dynamic policy requests from ue to af --- based on existing network selection procedure this solution defines a new list of hosting network that used for accessing to the target hosting network for the localized service when needed a list of hosting networks includes at least npn id optional valid time orand area information this list has highest priority for the ue to select when it is used or activated when the localized service in the hosting network is finished the list of hosting network is deactivated so that ue can perform normal network selection the following principle applies for the list of hosting network with highest priority when performing automatic network selection even higher than hplmn assumed that ue registered to one hosting network successfully for the expected localized service when ue moves into the coverage of hplmn based on existing logic of network selection ue has to select higher prioritized networkeg hplmn and then the localized service will be interrupted so the list of hosting network has higher priority than any other network for ue to perform network selection including even hplmn can be activated or deactivated by ue or home network eg when ue attempts to access the hosting network for the localized service or when the localized service is finished or home network sends the instruction to ue etc can be preconfigured or dynamic delivered by home network can be used for specific time orand specific area orand specific localized services editors note how to obtain the list of hosting networks is ffs --- this procedure is used by nf consumers of analytics id to request

interested in instances of ioc like networkslice which are concepts introduced to manage slices by classical configuration management instead the consumer of a management system wants to request mobile communication for ue without the need to know about details of the management system the management system needs to offer the flexibility as provided by the network architecture described in ts while at the same time any request needs to obey to the limitations of the architecture the following paragraphs give a brief summary of the basic concepts of qos and slicing which are the basis for intentdriven management of network slices the qos framework clause and network slicing clause are two independent key features of the gpp mobile network architecture according to ts one network slice identified by its snssai supports one or more pdu connectivity service pdu sessions ie services that provide exchange of pdus between a ue and a data network identified by a dnn each pdu connectivity service contains one or more qos flows which might be of different qos characteristics and which all terminate at the same dnn via the same upf each qos flow is associated to one requested qos profile and additionally might be associated to alternative qos profiles depending on the experienced network conditions the network can switch between these qos profiles on one hand this concept is the basis to use network slices as internal means for the network operator to partition the network in a way that qos flows of similar qos characteristics are grouped to pdu connectivity services that are tagged by the same snssai this specific combination of qos and network slicing results in that network slices as a whole might be optimized for certain traffic ie to optimize certain nf specifically for the assigned traffic and to assign these nf in nrf to the snssai an operator might prepare several of such network slices for traffic of different qos characteristics once a customer requests a pdu connectivity service that matches the qos characteristics of such prepared network slice the operator assigns the pdu connectivity services to the correspondingly optimized network slice on the other hand the concept offers the flexibility for csp and nop to offer to cscs a dedicated network slice as a product that carries all pdu connectivity services as the csc requires potentially towards different dnns eg local breakout in the tenants computing centre public voice to ims and towards public internet while each pdu connectivity service might carry multiple qos flows of different qos this flexibility enables the csc to request pdu connectivity services that are terminating at dnn as required by the csc eg breakout at local upf and that carry qos flows of specific qos characteristics depending on technical bordering conditions of the requested pdu connectivity services and by the business model of csp and nop csp or nop might use the snssai to group pdu connectivity services to network slices --- as specified in clause of gpp ts for home routed pdu sessions there is nas sm information that the vsmf and hsmf need to interpret and nas sm information that the vsmf only needs to transfer between the ue and hsmf but which it does not need to interpret nas sm information that only needs to be transferred between the ue and hsmf by the vsmf can be extended in later versions or releases of the nas specification eg defining new fields or values within existing ies and the extensions should not impact the vsmf besides in hr roaming scenarios the vsmf and hsmf can comply to different versions or releases of the nas specification it should be possible to support new sm features only requiring support from the hsmf without impacting the vsmf when the hsmf complies with a more recent release than the vsmf eg defining new nas sm ies in signalling from the ue to the hsmf andor signalling from the hsmf to the ue --- to support pdu set integrated packet handling with qos differentiation this solution proposes key principles the general architecture to support this is shown in figure three principles are adhered to pdu set qos treatment is determined by policy using dynamic or nondynamic pcc policy is enforced at the ran based on ngap signalling between the ran and smf user plane packet marking at the upf should indicate the characteristics of a given pdu not qos handling such as the priority to be provided to a pdu note that priority level is already a qos parameter sent via ngap rtp header extensions for scalable media streams are proposed by the ietf in draftietfavtextframemarking the header extension identifies the temporal and spatial media layers associated with a packet as well as dependencies of enhancement layer instances on base layer instances this allows layers to be selectively forwarded or otherwise handled in the network the solution adopted for this key issue should provide comparable capability for the gs in the gs a qos flow can carry multiple application flow instances of the same type eg two hx video streams as well as application flow instances of different types eg hx video ac audio haptic data to maintain this capability while providing perpdu set handling it must be possible to distinguish between these application media subflows within a qos flow one option for doing so is to consider the application mediastream subflow as a pdu set to which a pdu may belong and to identify it as such in the gtpu header figure gs support for pdu family integrated packet handling

for functions such as how to deliver multicast and broadcast communications including support within certain location areas mobility mbs session management and qos and covers interworking with eutran and epc based embms for public safety eg mcx services the wi is linked to the ran wi on nr multicast and broadcast services as documented in ts the following features for g multicast and broadcast service are specified architectural enhancement mbs architecture defined in ts follows the g system architectural principles enabling distribution of the mbs data from the gs ingress to ngran nodes and then to the ue qos model and parameters as defined in ts also apply to multicastbroadcast communication services with several differences documented in ts the policy and charging control framework as defined in ts applies to multicast and broadcast services ie for mbs session binding qos flow binding pcc rules for mbs session and policy information gc individual mbs traffic delivery is for multicast only and in which gc receives a single copy of multicast packets and delivers separate copies of those multicast packets to individual ues via perue pdu sessions hence for each such ue one pdu session is required to be associated with a multicast mbs session gc shared mbs traffic delivery can be used for multicast and broadcast and in which gc receives a single copy of mbs data packets and delivers a single copy of those mbs data packets to a ran node see following figure for details figure user plane data transmission example gc should authorize the af for delivering mbs data to the gc andor interacting with the gc nef perform authorization to the external af for determination of whether the interaction with the gc is allowed or not multicast communication service it aims at providing the same service and same specific content data to a dedicated set of ues the following characteristics for multicast are included in the wi for multicast mbs session gc authorizes the ue based on the mbs subscription data based on mbs subscription data of the ue and the mbs session information local multicast service is the multicast mbs service limited in a certain mbs service area and it is enforced by ngran node and gc a location dependent multicast service is an mbs service provided in several mbs service areas when ue moves to a new mbs service area content data from the new mbs service area shall be delivered to the ue and the network ceases to deliver the content data from the old mbs service areas to the ue mobility support of mbs service ue may move from one ngran node to another ngran node after ue has joined the mb session to minimize the data loss of the ue during the handover procedure multicast mbs session data may be forwarded from source ngran node to target ngran node session activation and deactivation the mbs session activation procedure is used for activating the resources for mbs data at ngran node the mbs session deactivation procedure is used for deactivating the resources for mbs data at ngran node resources can be efficiently used by a proper control of session activationdeactivation broadcast communication service it is to provide the same service and the same specific content data are provided simultaneously to all ues in a geographical area for location dependent broadcast service it is similar as the one for multicast

the api invoker in figure can either be an application on the ue or the af figure business relationships in sna the api invoker has service agreement with a capif provider and the api provider provides apis associated with the resource owner the capif provider and the api provider can be part of the same organization eg plmn operator as described in gpp ts clause when the capif provider is a plmn operator the resource owner may be a subscriber of the plmn note in the current release both the capif provider and the api provider should belong to the same organization eg plmn operator ---

with regard to resiliency ts includes only the following note note for resiliency a gnbdu may be connected to multiple gnbcus by appropriate implementation furthermore multiple tnl associations toward

multicast and broadcast services ie for mbs session binding qos flow binding pcc rules for mbs session and policy information gc individual mbs traffic delivery is for multicast only and in which gc receives a single copy of multicast packets and delivers separate copies of those multicast packets to individual ues via perue pdu sessions hence for each such ue one pdu session is required to be associated with a multicast mbs session gc shared mbs traffic delivery can be used for multicast and broadcast and in which gc receives a single copy of mbs data packets and delivers a single copy of those mbs data packets to a ran node see following figure for details figure user plane data transmission example gc should authorize the af for delivering mbs data to the gc andor interacting with the gc nef perform authorization to the external af for determination of whether the interaction with the gc is allowed or not multicast communication service it aims at providing the same service and same specific content data to a dedicated set of ues the following characteristics for multicast are included in the wi for multicast mbs session gc authorizes the ue based on the mbs subscription data based on mbs subscription data of the ue and the mbs session information local multicast service is the multicast mbs service limited in a certain mbs service area and it is enforced by ngran node and gc a location dependent multicast service is an mbs service provided in several mbs service areas when ue moves to a new mbs service area content data from the new mbs service area shall be delivered to the ue and the network ceases to deliver the content data from the old mbs service areas to the ue mobility support of mbs service ue may move from one ngran node to another ngran node after ue has joined the mb session to minimize the data loss of the ue during the handover procedure multicast mbs session data may be forwarded from source ngran node to target ngran node session activation and deactivation the mbs session activation procedure is used for activating the resources for mbs data at ngran node the mbs session deactivation procedure is used for deactivating the

ngran based on configuration may retrieve the nbiot ue priority and the expected ue behaviour parameters from the amf if not previously retrieved based on such parameters the ngran may apply prioritisation between requests from different ues before triggering step and throughout the rrc connection the ngran may retrieve additional parameters eg ue radio capabilities ngran forwards the nas

rrcearlydatarequest message was received in step the ngran includes edt session indication in the n initial ue message the rai signalled by mac based on the buffer status report bsr see ts shall not be used when using control plane ciot gs optimisations amf checks the integrity of the incoming nas message and deciphers the pdu session id and uplink data if a nas rai is received from the ue and it conflicts with the expected ue behaviour the nas rai takes precedence a if the amf received edt session indication from the ngran in step the amf sends an n message to the ngran a in the case of nas rai with uplink data and it indicated that downlink data was not expected and the amf does not expect any other signalling with the ue the amf shall either send a nas service accept in the n downlink nas transport message and include end indication to indicate that no further data or signalling is expected with the ue or alternatively the amf sends an n connection establishment indication message including end indication to indicate that no further data or signalling is expected with the ue b if the amf determines more data or signalling may be pending the amf sends an n downlink nas transport

management modes for snpn under mnovertical managed mode for pninpn and mnovertical managed mode for snpn the vertical also plays the role of npn operator shared with mobile network operator to achieve management on the npn served for the vertical therefore a bundle of management capabilities and corresponding managed resources should be exposed to the vertical from the mobile network operator according to the business agreement between the two parties under mnovertical managed mode figure vertical managing pninpn through exposure figure as an example illustrates how the plmn operator and the vertical manage the pninpn under the mnovertical managed mode the pninpn which is deployed across one plmn and the verticals premises eg factory can be seen as an endtoend network composed of two differentiated segments one public consisting of a ran and network functions built upon public gc network resources and one private consisting of network functions deployed using nonpublic g network resources the vertical can realize the management of pninpn through management capabilities exposure figure vertical managing snpn through exposure figure as an example illustrates how the plmn operator and the vertical manage the snpn under the mnovertical managed mode the snpn is deployed as an independent isolated network all snpn network elements are located inside the logical perimeter of the verticals premises eg factory and the snpn is separate from the plmn the plmn operator and the vertical play the role of snpn operator together and the vertical can realize the management of snpn through management capabilities exposure exposing what kind of management capability and managed resources eg local upf gnbs belong to vertical covering specific geographic areas etc for vertical relies on specific cases such as as described in clause the capability of monitoring network errors and alarms could be exposed to vertical to support its fault rootcause analysis localization etc on npn according to the issue described in clause the capability of configuring the npn network resources especially for those assets belong to the vertical eg local upf or local gnbs covering specific geographic areas for a specific vertical could further be exposed to vertical to satisfy the specific logical andor physical resource isolation requirements for energy applications categorized into different safety zones according to the issue described in clause the capability of monitoring kpiskqis like communication service availability endtoend latency etc could further be exposed to vertical to detect performance degradation and support performance optimization on npn --- this clause describes the procedure for path switch from a g prose uetonetwork relay to mbs session figure illustrates path switch from a g prose uetonetwork relay to mbs session figure path switch from a g prose uetonetwork relay to mbs session the remote mc service client is receiving the mc service media using the unicast delivery via a g prose uetonetwork relay ue this step applies to both g prose layer and layer uetonetwork relay based on the remote mc service ues path selection policies described in gpp ts and once the ngran based measurement report discussed in gpp ts is triggered due to network coverage detectionthe remote mc service ue connects to the network via the uuinterface note the path selection policies may be preconfigured in the mc service ue or provided by the pcf as defined in gpp ts for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay without the support of niwf the remote mc service client performs sip reregistration over uu and initiates the ims service continuity procedures as described in annex b further the mc service server sends mc service communications using unicast delivery which traverses over uu to the remote mc service client note for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay via the support of niwf the remote mc service ue performs registration procedures towards the gs to establish the necessary resources over the uuinterface note for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay the gc can provide the service continuity for the remote mc service ue with the ues original ip address as described in gpp ts the mc service client receives the mc service communication over a unicast pdu session optionally the mc service server may send the mbs session announcement to the remote mc service client with the information of the mbs session note the information of the mbs session can be available at the remote mc service client due to a previous mc service signalling via the relay ue a if a multicast mbs session has been announced the mc service ue performs a ue session join towards the gc using the mbs session information and the mc service client may send a ue session join notification towards the server b if a broadcast mbs session has been announced the mc service client start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast mbs session the mc service client sends an mbs listening status report which indicates the mbs reception quality associated with the mbs session id is sufficient to receive media note it is implementation specific whether the mbs session reception quality level is determined per mbs session per media stream or per mbs qos flow level via eg measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the ngran nodes packet loss based on the report received from mc service client in step the mc service server determines to stop sending the mc service communications eg dl media application layer control signalling using the unicast delivery further the mc server sends the mc service communications via the mbs session the mc service client receives the mc service communications from the mc service server via the mbs session --- during registration procedure in gs the ue sends ue policy container including the list of psis and ursp delivery over eps indication to amf in registration request as described in clause of ts amf transparently forwards ue policy container to uepcf during ue policy association establishment as described in clause

ue with at least one pdu sessionpdn connection is described in clause a a network slice subject to both nsac and eps counting shall be configured with only one of the options maximum number of registered ues andor maximum number of pdu session or maximum number of ues with at least one pdu sessionpdn connection andor maximum number of pdu session if eps counting is required for a network slice the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice is performed at the time of pdn connection establishment in case of epc interworking to support the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice in epc the smfpgwc is configured with the information indicating which network slice is subject to nsac during pdn connection establishment in epc the smfpgwc selects an snssai associated with the pdn connection as described in clause if the selected snssai by the smfpgwc is subject to the nsac the smfpgwc triggers interaction with nsacf to check the availability of the network slice by invoking separate nsac procedures for number of ue and number of pdu session as described in clause of ts before the smfpgwc provides the selected snssai to the ue if the network slice is available the smfpgwc continues to proceed with the pdn connection establishment procedure the nsacf performs the following for checking network slice availability prior to returning a response to the smfpgwc for nsac for number of ues if the ue identity is already included in the list of ue ids registered with a network slice or the ue identity is not included in the list of ue ids registered with a network slice and the current number of ue registration did not reach the maximum number the nsacf responds to the smfpgwc with the information that the network slice is available the nsacf includes the ue identity in the list of ue ids if not already on the list and increases the current number of ue registration otherwise the nsacf returns a response indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been reached if hierarchical nsac architecture is deployed when the local maximum number or local threshold is reached the nsacf may interact with the primary nsacf before it returns the response back to the smfpgwc for more details on handling at the nsacf and primary nsacf see clause for nsac for number of pdu sessions if the current number of pdu sessions is below the maximum number the nsacf responds to the smfpgwc with the information that the network slice is available the nsacf increases the current number of pdu sessions otherwise the nsacf returns the response indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been reached if hierarchical nsac architecture is deployed when the local maximum number is reached the nsacf may interact with the primary nsacf before it returns the response back to the smfpgwc for more details on handling at the nsacf and primary nsacf see clause if the maximum number of ues andor the maximum number of pdu sessions has already been reached unless operator policy implements a different action the smfpgwc rejects the pdn connection note as an implementation option if the apn is mapped to more than one snssai and the first selected snssai is not available eg either current number of ue registration reached maximum or current number of pdu sessions reached maximum then based on the operator policy the pgwcsmf can try another mapped snssai for the pdn connection establishment procedure if the establishment of a new pdn connections is with a different smfpgwc from the smfpgwc used for already existing pdn connection associated with the same snssai each smfpgwc will send a request for update eg increase or decrease to the nsacf the nsacf may maintain a registration entry per smfpgwc for the same ue id the smfpgwc provides the access type to the nsacf when triggering a request to increase or decrease the number of ues andor the number of pdu sessions for an snssai note the smfpgwc determines the access type based on the rat type parameter in the pmip or gtp message received from the epdg or alternatively it can internally determine the access type based on the source node eg sgw sending the request for the pdn connection establishment when the ue with ongoing pdn connections moves from epc to gc the smfpgwc triggers a request to decrease the number of the ue registration in nsacf and the amf triggers a request to increase the number of the ue registration in nsacf when the ue is registered in the new amf if there are more than one pdn connections associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc the smfpgwc triggers a request to increase the number of the ue registration in nsacf and the old amf triggers a request to decrease the number of the ue registration in nsacf when the ue is deregistered in old amf if there are more than one pdu sessions associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs the nsacf maintains a list of ue ids based on the requests from smfpgwcs and amf and adjusts the current number of registrations accordingly when eps counting is performed for a network slice and the ue with ongoing pdn connections moves from epc to gc session continuity is guaranteed from nsac standpoint as the admission was granted at the time of pdn connection establishment ie the number of pdu session is not counted again in gc similarly when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc session continuity is guaranteed from nsac standpoint as the admission of the pdn connections to the network slice was already granted at the time of pdu session establishment in gc if the pdn connection associated with snssai is released in epc the smfpgwc triggers a request ie decrease to nsacf for maximum number of ues andor maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice control the nsacf decreases the current number of registrations and removes the ue identity from the list of ue ids if the pdn connections associated with the snssai are all released in epc note nsac in epc is not performed for the attachment without pdn connectivity if eps counting is not required for a network slice the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice is performed when the ue moves from epc to gc ie when the ue performs mobility registration procedure from epc to gc nsac for maximum number of ues per network slice andor when the pdn connections are handed over from epc to gc nsac for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice the smfpgwc is configured with the information indicating the network slice is subject to nsac only in gs the pdn connection interworking procedure is performed as described in clause mobility from epc to gc does not guarantee all active pdu sessions can be transferred to the gc in certain circumstances when either the current number of ue registration or the current number of pdu sessions would exceed the maximum number when the ue moves from epc to gc when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc the smfpgwc triggers a request to decrease the number of pdu session to nsacf if there are more than one pdu sessions associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs and nsacf removes the pdu session ids while decreasing the number of pdu sessions note given that session continuity is not guaranteed when eps counting is not required it is recommended for services which require the session continuity to support eps counting note when multiple nsacfs are deployed and if the number of ue in target nsacf has reached the maximum number whether session continuity can be guaranteed is left to implementation note when a centralized architecture is deployed ue admission is guaranteed at intersystem and interamf mobility if the same nsacf is selected this is the case for nonroaming scenarios and for roaming scenarios with hplmn nsac admission mode described in clause --- figure illustrates the network slice fault management process to address the key issue of network slice fault management described in clause preconditions the val client has subscribed to the network slice fault management capability the network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with nef and oam system the val client has checked the status of application layer figure network slice fault management process the val server sends a request to nsce server to request for the fault diagnosis of the applications and networks when it detected a fault in the application layer the services and the network slices this request may be triggered by the errors of the applications detected by the val server itself or the val server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report subscribing to the network slice fault management capability the fault information of applications may be included in this request for example the service availability failure events eg described as fallback events carried out by the dual sim cellular device on receiving the request from val server nsce server retrieves the performance data of network slice from gs for oam system the apis defined in clause ts is utilized for cn functions the apis of nnwdafanalyticsinfo service defined in clause ts can be utilized the analytics data defined in clause to clause ts network slice instance related performance data defined in clause ts and network analytics data in clause and clause ts exposed by oam system may be acquired nsce server retrieves the alarms of network slice instances from oam system via the procedures defined in clause ts and the alarms are defined in clause ts eg the fault of communication environmental equipment processing error qos for deviceresourcefilefunctionalitysmallest nsce server may request the alarm information eg the gs network is not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the services problem collected by nsce client if possible the information collected by the nsce client depends on the thirdparties requirements and implementation nsce client report the requested fault information to nsce server nsce server correlates the applications services and the network resources of the specific network slice instances which supports the applications and services with the snssai nsi id nsinstanceid defined in ts application identifier defined in and then diagnoses the causes of the fault of the applications or services by analysing the fault information from different sources for example the ran function of the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application for a certain time duration the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by service availability failure events and in the ran function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time duration then the environment fault may be the root cause of the service availability failure and should be prioritized to be solved the fault may be identified with critical major minor ignore to show its prioritization nsce server response to val server with the reports of fault diagnostic result to indicate the causes of the failures of the applications or services if there is no problem within the gs network the val server may be requested to check the application layer itself again if the nsce server detects that the applicationservice error is caused by the gs the val server may send the fault diagnosis report to oam system to indicate the server fault which causes the applicationservice failure by utilizing the nsceoam interface note the apis utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to oam will reutilize the fault management services in ts exposed by egmf as defined in ts --- the request type in step indicates existing pdu session or existing emergency pdu session the smf determines that the request is due to switching between gpp access and nongpp access or due to handover from eps the smf identifies the existing pdu session based on the pdu session id in such a case the smf does not create a new sm context but instead updates the existing sm context and provides the representation of the updated sm context to the amf in the response if the request type is initial request and if the old pdu session id is included in nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext request the smf identifies the existing pdu session to be released based on the old pdu session id subscription data includes the allowed pdu session types allowed ssc modes default qi and arp subscribed sessionambr smfassociated external parameters ip index or static ip addressprefix may be included in the subscription data if the ue has subscribed to it the smf checks the validity of the ue request it checks whether the ue request is compliant with the user subscription and with local policies if the selected dnn corresponds to an ladn whether the ue is located within the ladn service area based on the ue presence in ladn service area indication from the amf if the amf does not provide the ue presence in ladn service area indication and the smf determines that the selected dnn corresponds to a ladn then the smf considers that the ue is out of the ladn service area the smf determines whether the pdu session requires redundancy and the smf determines the rsn as described in clause of ts if the smf determines that redundant handling is not allowed or not possible for the given pdu session the smf shall either reject the establishment of the pdu session or accept the establishment of a pdu session without redundancy handling based on local policy if the ue request is considered as not valid the smf decides to not accept to establish the pdu session note the smf can instead of the nudmsdmget service operation use the nudmsdmsubscribe service operation with an immediate report indication that triggers the udm to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the smf and the udm for a disaster roaming service the udm provides the session management subscription data to the smf based on the local policy andor the local configuration as specified in clause of ts for an snssai subject to nsac and if lbo applies the smf in supporting vplmn stores the applicable nsac admission mode from smf to amf either nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext response cause sm context id or n sm container pdu session reject cause or an nsmfpdusessionupdatesmcontext response depending on the request received in step if the smf received nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext request in step and the smf is able to process the pdu session establishment request the smf creates an sm context and responds to the amf by providing an sm context id if the up security policy for the pdu session is determined to have integrity protection set to required the smf may based on local configuration decide whether to accept or reject the pdu session request based on the ue integrity protection maximum data rate note the smf can eg be configured to reject a pdu session if the ue integrity protection maximum data rate has a very low value if the services provided by the dn would require higher bitrates when the smf decides to not accept to establish a pdu session the smf rejects the ue request via nas sm signalling including a relevant sm rejection cause by responding to the amf with nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext response the smf also indicates to the amf that the pdu session id is to be considered as released the smf proceeds to step and the pdu session establishment procedure is stopped optional secondary authenticationauthorization if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session the smf does not perform secondary authenticationauthorization if the request type received in step indicates emergency request or existing emergency pdu session the smf shall not perform secondary authenticationauthorization if the smf needs to perform secondary authenticationauthorization during the establishment of the pdu session by a dnaaa server as described in clause of ts the smf triggers the pdu session establishment authenticationauthorization as described in clause a if dynamic pcc is to be used for the pdu session the smf performs pcf selection as described in clause of ts if the request type indicates existing pdu session or existing emergency pdu session the smf shall use the pcf already selected for the pdu session otherwise the smf may apply local policy b the smf may perform an sm policy association establishment procedure as defined in clause to establish an sm policy association with the pcf and get the default pcc rules for the pdu session the smf shall include the gpp data off status if received in step the gpsi pvs fqdns andor pvs ip addresses and the onboarding indication shall be included if available at smf in the case of onsnpn the smf shall include both the snssai and the alternative snssai if received in step if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session the smf provides information on the policy control request trigger conditions that have been met by an smf initiated sm policy association modification procedure as defined in clause the pcf may provide policy information defined in clause and in ts to smf the ursp rule enforcement in step may be included if smf receives the ursp rule enforcement from ue as

npcfpolicyauthorizationsubscribe eventid set to ue reporting connection capabilities from associated ursp rule eventfilter set to at least list of connection capabilities to the pcf for the pdu session the pcf for session may notify the pcf for ue about the ursp rule enforcement together with the pdu session parameters that this application associated with by npcfpolicyauthorizationnotify during the sm policy association establishment procedure if the pcf detects the request relates to sm policy association enabling integration with tsn or tsc or deterministic networking as defined in ts clause based on local configuration the pcf may provide policy control request trigger for gs bridgerouter information as defined in clause of ts the pcf based on the emergency dnn sets the arp of the pcc rules to a value that is reserved for emergency services as described in ts note the purpose of step is to receive pcc rules before selecting upf if pcc rules are not needed as input for upf selection step can be performed after step during the sm policy association establishment procedure for a nonroaming pdu session if a snssai is subject to network slice usage control the pcf may provide a slice usage policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a pdu session inactivity timer value as described in clause of ts if the request type in step indicates initial request the smf selects an ssc mode for the pdu session as described in clause of ts the smf also selects one or more upfs as needed as described in clause of ts in the case of pdu session type ipv or ipv or ipvv the smf allocates an ip addressprefix for the pdu session unless configured otherwise as described in clause of ts in the case of pdu session type ipv or ipvv the smf also allocates an interface identifier to the ue for the ue to build its linklocal address for unstructured pdu session type the smf may allocate an ipv prefix for the pdu session and n pointtopoint tunnelling based on udpipv as described in clause of ts for ethernet pdu session type neither a mac nor an ip address is allocated by the smf to the ue for this pdu session if the amf indicated control plane ciot gs optimisation in step for this pdu session then for unstructured pdu session type the smf checks whether ues subscription include a nef identity for nidd for the dnnsnssai combination when the nef identity for nidd is present in the ues subscription data the smf will select the nef identified for the snssai and selected dnn in the nef identity for nidd as the anchor of this pdu session otherwise the smf will select a upf as the anchor of this pdu session for other pdu session types the smf will perform upf selection to select a upf as the anchor of this pdu session if the request type in step is existing pdu session the smf maintains the same ip addressprefix that has already been allocated to the ue in the source network if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session referring to an existing pdu session moved between gpp access and nongpp access the smf maintains the ssc mode of the pdu session the current pdu session anchor and ip address note the smf may decide to trigger eg new intermediate upf insertion or allocation of a new upf as described in step in clause if the request type indicates emergency request the smf selects the upf as described in clause of ts and selects ssc mode smf may select a upf eg based on requested dnnsnssai that supports nwtt functionality smf may select a psa upf that supports pdu set identification and marking for a qos flow with pdu set based handling capability smf may perform an smf initiated sm policy association modification procedure as defined in clause to provide information on the policy control request trigger conditions that have been met if request type is initial request and dynamic pcc is deployed and pdu session type is ipv or ipv or ipvv smf notifies the pcf if the policy control request trigger condition is met with the allocated ue ip addressprefixes note if an ip addressprefix has been allocated before step eg subscribed static ip addressprefix in udmudr or the step is performed after step the ip addressprefix can be provided to pcf in step and the ip addressprefix notification in this step can be skipped pcf may provide updated policies to the smf the pcf may provide policy information defined in clause and in ts to smf the pcf for pdu session may generate pcc rule based on the ursp rule eg connection capability referring to the clause in ts note mapping between connection capability and sdf templates in the pcc rule is implementation specific if request type indicates initial request the smf initiates an n session establishment procedure with the selected upfs otherwise it initiates an n session modification procedure with the selected upfs a the smf sends an n session establishmentmodification request to the upf and provides packet detection enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the upf for this pdu session if the smf is configured to request ip address allocation from upf as described in clause of ts then the smf indicates to the upf to perform the ip addressprefix allocation and includes the information required for the upf to perform the allocation if the selective user plane deactivation is required for this pdu session the smf determines the inactivity timer and provides it to the upf for a pdu session for nonroaming subscribers if the snssai of the pdu session is subject to network slice usage control the smf obtains the pdu session inactivity timer value for the pdu session as described in step or step or uses preconfigured value and configures the upf to run the pdu session inactivity

in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway both the roaming figure and nonroaming figure scenarios are depicted in the figure in the roaming case the vpcrf acts as an intermediary sending the qos policy rules provision from the hpcrf in the hplmn to the trusted nongpp ip access in the vplmn the vpcrf receives the acknowledgment from the trusted nongpp ip access and forwards it to the hpcrf in the nonroaming case the vpcrf is not involved at all the trusted nongpp ip access receives an ipcan specific resource allocation or resource release request initiated by the ue the trusted nongpp ip access initiates the gateway control and qos policy rules request procedure as specified in ts the trusted nongpp ip access provides the ue request or release of resources as an event report the pcrf makes a pcc decision as a result of the gateway control and qos policy request and provides the updated qos rules to the trusted nongpp ip access an ipcan specific resource allocation or resource release procedure may be triggered by the enforcement of the received policy rules in this step a response for the resource requestrelease is sent to the ue the trusted nongpp ip access indicates to the pcrf whether the requested qos policy rules provision could be enforced or not and thus completing the gw control and qos rules provision procedure the pcrf initiates the policy and charging rules provision procedure as specified in ts to update the pcc rules in the pdn gw the updated

the parameters included in the request are defined in clause of ts the nf can request statistics or predictions or both the consumer provides the tais or cell ids andor finer granularity area eg below cell via longitudelatitude range etc in location information when requesting qos sustainability analytics if the af doesnt provide tais or cell ids the nwdaf as an gc internal nf is expected to obtain such information ie to determine which cells are related to the finer granularity area the consumer may optionally provide ue context or subscription information such as one or more of the following device speed or speed range serving upf node information subscriber category as in ts clause device model device manufacturer imei or imeisv or tac range supported frequency bands equipment type a if the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested analytics the nwdaf decides the amfs based on the taiscell ids and obtains the ue list in the tascells from amf by invoking namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation using event id number of ues present in a geographical area as described in ts b the nwdaf invokes namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the update of the ue list using event id ue moving in or out of area of interest as described in ts the nwdaf initiates the lcs service request to the gmlclmf to get the location and optionally the speed of ues from ue list provided by the amf in step the gmlclmf initiates the ue location service procedure and gets the location of the ues the gmlclmf provides location information for each ue in the ue list to the nwdaf from the list of ue locations returned by the gmlclmf the nwdaf identifies the ues located in finer granularity area by comparing the ues locations to the finer granularity area provided in step the nwdaf invokes namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the serving smf for the ue based on the serving smf in step the nwdaf invokes nsmfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the upf information for the ue the nwdaf may collect qos information either from the upf directly or subscribe to the upf via the smf the qos information may include the bandwidth packet delay for the ue and the information on the serving upf node id optionally the nwdaf may collect additional information for the ue context or ue subscription from the udm such as subscriber category pei if available pei may be used to retrieve from gsma database additional information such as device model device manufacturer imei or imeisv or tac range supported frequency bands equipment type such additional information may be used by nwdaf to add more information to the collected measurements and filter those measurements that are applicable to the ue and subscription context for which analytics are requested by the service consumer the nwdaf verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives the requested analytics the nwdaf can detect the need for notification based on comparing the requested analytics of the target qi against the reporting thresholds provided by the consumer in any cell over the requested analytics target period the nwdaf provides the response or notification on qos sustainability to the nf consumer note nwdaf may decide to ignore some of the filters if collected measurements are not sufficient to derive meaningful analytics in such scenario a warning message is provided in the response or notification to the nf consumer note in order to reduce the amount of information collected per measurement point the additional information from udm may only be collected for the events of gbr unfulfillment in this way the additional analytics filter information may only be supported for qi of resource type gbr and for events of gbr unfulfillment --- this solution addresses key issue --- in this scenario consider two separate gpp networks one gpp network with a satellite iot access network and satellite nr access network

based on existing network selection procedure this solution defines a new list of hosting network that used for accessing to the target hosting network for the localized service when needed a list of hosting networks includes at least npn id optional valid time orand area information this list has highest priority for the ue to select when it is used or activated when the localized service in the hosting network is finished the list of hosting network is deactivated so that ue can perform normal network selection the following principle applies for the list of hosting network with highest priority when performing automatic network selection even higher than hplmn assumed that ue registered to one hosting network successfully for the expected localized service when ue moves into the coverage of hplmn based on existing logic of network selection ue has to select higher prioritized networkeg hplmn and then the localized service will be interrupted so the list of hosting network has higher priority than any other network for ue to perform network selection including even hplmn can be activated or deactivated by ue or home network eg when ue attempts to access the hosting network for the localized service or when the localized service is finished or home network sends the instruction to ue etc can be preconfigured or dynamic delivered by home network can be used for specific time orand specific area orand specific localized services editors note how to obtain the list of hosting networks is ffs --- this procedure is used by nf consumers of analytics id to request

interested in instances of ioc like networkslice which are concepts introduced to manage slices by classical configuration management instead the consumer of a management system wants to request mobile communication for ue without the need to know about details of the management system the management system needs to offer the flexibility as provided by the network architecture described in ts while at the same time any request needs to obey to the limitations of the architecture the following paragraphs give a brief summary of the basic concepts of qos and slicing which are the basis for intentdriven management of network slices the qos framework clause and network slicing clause are two independent key features of the gpp mobile network architecture according to ts one network slice identified by its snssai supports one or more pdu connectivity service pdu sessions ie services that provide exchange of pdus between a ue and a data network identified by a dnn each pdu connectivity service contains one or more qos flows which might be of different qos characteristics and which all terminate at the same dnn via the same upf each qos flow is associated to one requested qos profile and additionally might be associated to alternative qos profiles depending on the experienced network conditions the network can switch between these qos profiles on one hand this concept is the basis to use network slices as internal means for the network operator to partition the network in a way that qos flows of similar qos characteristics are grouped to pdu connectivity services that are tagged by the same snssai this specific combination of qos and network slicing results in that network slices as a whole might be optimized for certain traffic ie to optimize certain nf specifically for the assigned traffic and to assign these nf in nrf to the snssai an operator might prepare several of such network slices for traffic of different qos characteristics once a customer requests a pdu connectivity service that matches the qos characteristics of such prepared network slice the operator assigns the pdu connectivity services to the correspondingly optimized network slice on the other hand the concept offers the flexibility for csp and nop to offer to cscs a dedicated network slice as a product that carries all pdu connectivity services as the csc requires potentially towards different dnns eg local breakout in the tenants computing centre public voice to ims and towards public internet while each pdu connectivity service might carry multiple qos flows of different qos this flexibility enables the csc to request pdu connectivity services that are terminating at dnn as required by the csc eg breakout at local upf and that carry qos flows of specific qos characteristics depending on technical bordering conditions of the requested pdu connectivity services and by the business model of csp and nop csp or nop might use the snssai to group pdu connectivity services to network slices --- as specified in clause of gpp ts for home routed pdu sessions there is nas sm information that the vsmf and hsmf need to interpret and nas sm information that the vsmf only needs to transfer between the ue and hsmf but which it does not need to interpret nas sm information that only needs to be transferred between the ue and hsmf by the vsmf can be

integrated packet handling with qos differentiation this solution proposes key principles the general architecture to support this is shown in figure three principles are adhered to pdu set qos treatment is determined by policy using dynamic or nondynamic pcc policy is enforced at the ran based on ngap signalling between the ran and smf user plane packet marking at the upf should indicate the characteristics of a given pdu not qos handling such as the priority to be provided to a pdu note that priority level is already a qos parameter sent via ngap rtp header extensions for scalable media streams are proposed by the ietf in draftietfavtextframemarking the header extension identifies the temporal and spatial media layers associated with a packet as well as dependencies of enhancement layer instances on base layer instances this allows layers to be selectively forwarded or otherwise handled in the network the solution adopted for this key issue should provide comparable capability for the gs in the gs a qos flow can carry multiple application flow instances of the same type eg two hx video streams as well as application flow instances of different types eg hx video ac audio haptic data to maintain this capability while providing perpdu set handling it must be possible to distinguish between these application media subflows within a qos flow one option for doing so is to consider the application mediastream subflow as a pdu set to which a pdu may belong and to identify it as such in the gtpu header figure gs support for pdu family integrated packet handling

contain the parameters as described in table table description of g access stratum time distribution parameters figure management of g access stratum time information am policy association establishment as described in clause in ts when the procedure is triggered by the af request to influence the g access stratum time distribution to create a new request the af provides access stratum time distribution parameters to the nef using the nnefasticreate service operation together with the af identifier and potentially further inputs as specified in table including a target one ue identified by supi or gpsi a group of ues identified by an external group identifier the nef maps the external group identifier to an internal group identifier and any gpsi to a supi to update or remove an existing request the af invokes an nnefastiupdate or nnefastidelete service operation providing the corresponding time synchronization configuration id to query the status of the access stratum time distribution the af invokes nnefastiget service operation providing the target list of ue identities supi or gpsi the af that is part of operators trust domain may invoke the services directly with the tsctsf note steps and can occur in any order when the procedure is triggered by the af request to influence the g access stratum time distribution the nef authorizes the request

id in step it shall include it in modify bearer request the mme releases the nonaccepted dedicated bearers by triggering the bearer release procedure as specified in clause if the serving gw receives a dl packet for a nonaccepted bearer the serving gw drops the dl packet and does not send a downlink data notification to the mme if the default bearer of a pdn connection has not been accepted by the target enodeb and there are other pdn connections active the mme shall handle it in the same way as if all bearers of a pdn connection have not been accepted the mme releases these pdn connections by triggering the mme requested pdn disconnection procedure specified in clause the serving gw for serving gw relocation this will be the target serving gw informs the pdn gws the change of for example for serving gw relocation or the rat type that eg can be used for charging by sending the message modify bearer request per pdn connection the sgw also includes user location information ie andor ue

in order to assist the reordering function in the target enodeb when the timer at the source sgsn started in step expires the source sgsn will cleanup all its resources towards source bss by performing the bss packet flow delete procedure the ue initiates a tracking area update procedure when one of the conditions listed in clause triggers for tracking area update applies the target mme knows that an irat handover has been performed for this ue as it received the bearer contexts by handover messages and therefore the target mme performs only a subset of the ta update procedure specifically it excludes the context transfer procedures between source sgsn and target mme if the subscription data received from the hss during the tau in step contains information that is necessary for the eutran to be aware of eg a restriction in the ues permission to use nr as a secondary rat unlicensed spectrum in the form of laalwalwipnru as specified in clause or a combination of them or an existing ue context in the mme indicates that the ue is not permitted to use nr as a secondary rat unlicensed spectrum or a combination of them and the mme has not provided this information to the target enodeb during step of the handover preparation phase then the mme sends an updated handover restriction list in the downlink nas transport message that it sends to eutran if the ue is not allowed to use nr as secondary rat the mme indicates that to the ue in tau accept message when the timer at the source sgsn started in step expires and if the source sgsn received the serving gw change indication in the forward relocation response message it deletes the eps bearer resources by sending delete session request cause operation indication messages to the source serving gw the operation indication flag is not set that indicates to the source serving gw that the source serving gw shall not initiate a delete procedure towards the pdn gw the source serving gw acknowledges with delete session response cause messages if isr has been activated before this procedure the cause indicates to the source sgw that the source sgw shall delete the bearer resources on the other old cn node by sending delete bearer request messages to that cn node if indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at source sgsn started at step triggers the source sgsn to send a delete indirect data forwarding tunnel request message to the sgw to release the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding if indirect forwarding was used and the serving gw is relocated then the expiry of the timer at target mme started at step triggers the target mme to send a delete indirect data forwarding tunnel request message to the target sgw to release temporary resources used for indirect forwarding --- table cgpp ts gprs session management timers ms side note typically the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the relevant timer exceptions are described in the

snpn under mnovertical managed mode for pninpn and mnovertical managed mode for snpn the vertical also plays the role of npn operator shared with mobile network operator to achieve management on the npn served for the vertical therefore a bundle of management capabilities and corresponding managed resources should be exposed to the vertical from the mobile network operator according to the business agreement between the two parties under mnovertical managed mode figure vertical managing pninpn through exposure figure as an example illustrates how the plmn operator and the vertical manage the pninpn under the mnovertical managed mode the pninpn which is deployed across one plmn and the verticals premises eg factory can be seen as an endtoend network composed of two differentiated segments one public consisting of a ran and network functions built upon public gc network resources and one private consisting of network functions deployed using nonpublic g network resources the vertical can realize the management of pninpn through management capabilities exposure figure vertical managing snpn through exposure figure as an example illustrates how the plmn operator and the vertical manage the snpn under the mnovertical managed mode the snpn is deployed as an independent isolated network all snpn network elements are located inside the logical perimeter of the verticals premises eg factory and the snpn is separate from the plmn the plmn operator and the vertical play the role of snpn operator together and the vertical can realize the management of snpn through management capabilities exposure exposing what kind of management capability and managed resources eg local upf gnbs belong to vertical covering specific geographic areas etc for vertical relies on specific cases such as as described in clause the capability of monitoring network errors and alarms could be exposed to vertical to support its fault rootcause analysis localization etc on npn according to the issue described in clause the capability of configuring the npn network resources especially for those assets belong to the vertical eg local upf or local gnbs covering specific geographic areas for a specific vertical could further be exposed to vertical to satisfy the specific logical andor physical resource isolation requirements for energy applications categorized into different safety zones according to the issue described in clause the capability of monitoring kpiskqis like communication service availability endtoend latency etc could further be exposed to vertical to detect performance degradation and support performance optimization on npn --- this clause describes the procedure for path switch from a g prose uetonetwork relay to mbs session figure illustrates path switch from a g prose uetonetwork relay to mbs session figure path switch from a g prose uetonetwork relay to mbs session the remote mc service client is receiving the mc service media using the unicast delivery via a g prose uetonetwork relay ue this step applies to both g prose layer and layer uetonetwork relay based on the remote mc service ues path selection policies described in gpp ts and once the ngran based measurement report discussed in gpp ts is triggered due to network coverage detectionthe remote mc service ue connects to the network via the uuinterface note the path selection policies may be preconfigured in the mc service ue or provided by the pcf as defined in gpp ts for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay without the support of niwf the remote mc service client performs sip reregistration over uu and initiates the ims service continuity procedures as described in annex b further the mc service server sends mc service communications using unicast delivery which traverses over uu to the remote mc service client note for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay via the support of niwf the remote mc service ue performs registration procedures towards the gs to establish the necessary resources over the uuinterface note for the case of g prose layer uetonetwork relay the gc can provide the service continuity for the remote mc service ue with the ues original ip address as described in gpp ts the mc service client receives the mc service communication over a unicast pdu session optionally the mc service server may send the mbs session announcement to the remote mc service client with the information of the mbs session note the information of the mbs session can be available at the remote mc service client due to a previous mc service signalling via the relay ue a if a multicast mbs session has been announced the mc service ue performs a ue session join towards the gc using the mbs session information and the mc service client may send a ue session join notification towards the server b if a broadcast mbs session has been announced the mc service client start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast mbs session the mc service client sends an mbs listening status report which indicates the mbs reception quality associated with the mbs session id is sufficient to receive media note it is implementation specific whether the mbs session reception quality level is determined per mbs session per media stream or per mbs qos flow level via eg measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the ngran nodes packet loss based on the report received from mc service client in step the mc service server determines to stop sending the mc service communications eg dl media application layer control signalling using the unicast delivery further the mc server sends the mc service communications via the mbs session the mc service client receives the mc service communications from the mc service server via the mbs session --- during registration procedure in gs the ue sends ue policy container including the list of psis and ursp delivery over eps indication

describes the nsac for maximum number of registered ues and for maximum number of pdu sessions for network slice subjected to eps interworking the nsac for maximum number of ue with at least one pdu sessionpdn connection is described in clause a a network slice subject to both nsac and eps counting shall be configured with only one of the options maximum number of registered ues andor maximum number of pdu session or maximum number of ues with at least one pdu sessionpdn connection andor maximum number of pdu session if eps counting is required for a network slice the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice is performed at the time of pdn connection establishment in case of epc interworking to support the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice in epc the smfpgwc is configured with the information indicating which network slice is subject to nsac during pdn connection establishment in epc the smfpgwc selects an snssai associated with the pdn connection as described in clause if the selected snssai by the smfpgwc is subject to the nsac the smfpgwc triggers interaction with nsacf to check the availability of the network slice by invoking separate nsac procedures for number of ue and number of pdu session as described in clause of ts before the smfpgwc provides the selected snssai to the ue if the network slice is available the smfpgwc continues to proceed with the pdn connection establishment procedure the nsacf performs the following for checking network slice availability prior to returning a response to the smfpgwc for nsac for number of ues if the ue identity is already included in the list of ue ids registered with a network slice or the ue identity is not included in the list of ue ids registered with a network slice and the current number of ue registration did not reach the maximum number the nsacf responds to the smfpgwc with the information that the network slice is available the nsacf includes the ue identity in the list of ue ids if not already on the list and increases the current number of ue registration otherwise the nsacf returns a response indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been reached if hierarchical nsac architecture is deployed when the local maximum number or local threshold is reached the nsacf may interact with the primary nsacf before it returns the response back to the smfpgwc for more details on handling at the nsacf and primary nsacf see clause for nsac for number of pdu sessions if the current number of pdu sessions is below the maximum number the nsacf responds to the smfpgwc with the information that the network slice is available the nsacf increases the current number of pdu sessions otherwise the nsacf returns the response indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been reached if hierarchical nsac architecture is deployed when the local maximum number is reached the nsacf may interact with the primary nsacf before it returns the response back to the smfpgwc for more details on handling at the nsacf and primary nsacf see clause if the maximum number of ues andor the maximum number of pdu sessions has already been reached unless operator policy implements a different action the smfpgwc rejects the pdn connection note as an implementation option if the apn is mapped to more than one snssai and the first selected snssai is not available eg either current number of ue registration reached maximum or current number of pdu sessions reached maximum then based on the operator policy the pgwcsmf can try another mapped snssai for the pdn connection establishment procedure if the establishment of a new pdn connections is with a different smfpgwc from the smfpgwc used for already existing pdn connection associated with the same snssai each smfpgwc will send a request for update eg increase or decrease to the nsacf the nsacf may maintain a registration entry per smfpgwc for the same ue id the smfpgwc provides the access type to the nsacf when triggering a request to increase or decrease the number of ues andor the number of pdu sessions for an snssai note the smfpgwc determines the access type based on the rat type parameter in the pmip or gtp message received from the epdg or alternatively it can internally determine the access type based on the source node eg sgw sending the request for the pdn connection establishment when the ue with ongoing pdn connections moves from epc to gc the smfpgwc triggers a request to decrease the number of the ue registration in nsacf and the amf triggers a request to increase the number of the ue registration in nsacf when the ue is registered in the new amf if there are more than one pdn connections associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc the smfpgwc triggers a request to increase the number of the ue registration in nsacf and the old amf triggers a request to decrease the number of the ue registration in nsacf when the ue is deregistered in old amf if there are more than one pdu sessions associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs the nsacf maintains a list of ue ids based on the requests from smfpgwcs and amf and adjusts the current number of registrations accordingly when eps counting is performed for a network slice and the ue with ongoing pdn connections moves from epc to gc session continuity is guaranteed from nsac standpoint as the admission was granted at the time of pdn connection establishment ie the number of pdu session is not counted again in gc similarly when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc session continuity is guaranteed from nsac standpoint as the admission of the pdn connections to the network slice was already granted at the time of pdu session establishment in gc if the pdn connection associated with snssai is released in epc the smfpgwc triggers a request ie decrease to nsacf for maximum number of ues andor maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice control the nsacf decreases the current number of registrations and removes the ue identity from the list of ue ids if the pdn connections associated with the snssai are all released in epc note nsac in epc is not performed for the attachment without pdn connectivity if eps counting is not required for a network slice the nsac for maximum number of ues andor for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice is performed when the ue moves from epc to gc ie when the ue performs mobility registration procedure from epc to gc nsac for maximum number of ues per network slice andor when the pdn connections are handed over from epc to gc nsac for maximum number of pdu sessions per network slice the smfpgwc is configured with the information indicating the network slice is subject to nsac only in gs the pdn connection interworking procedure is performed as described in clause mobility from epc to gc does not guarantee all active pdu sessions can be transferred to the gc in certain circumstances when either the current number of ue registration or the current number of pdu sessions would exceed the maximum number when the ue moves from epc to gc when the ue with ongoing pdu sessions moves from gc to epc the smfpgwc triggers a request to decrease the number of pdu session to nsacf if there are more than one pdu sessions associated with the snssai the nsacf may receive multiple requests for the same snssai from different smfpgwcs and nsacf removes the pdu session ids while decreasing the number of pdu sessions note given that session continuity is not guaranteed when eps counting is not required it is recommended for services which require the session continuity to support eps counting note when multiple nsacfs are deployed and if the number of ue in target nsacf has reached the maximum number whether session continuity can be guaranteed is left to implementation note when a centralized architecture is deployed ue admission is guaranteed at intersystem and interamf mobility if the same nsacf is selected this is the case for nonroaming scenarios and for roaming scenarios with hplmn nsac admission mode described in clause --- figure illustrates the network slice fault management process to address the key issue of network slice fault management described in clause preconditions the val client has subscribed to the network slice fault management capability the network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with nef and oam system the val client has checked the status of application layer figure network slice fault management process the val server sends a request to nsce server to request for the fault diagnosis of the applications and networks when it detected a fault in the application layer the services and the network slices this request may be triggered by the errors of the applications detected by the val server itself or the val server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report subscribing to the network slice fault management capability the fault information of applications may be included in this request for example the service availability failure events eg described as fallback events carried out by the dual sim cellular device on receiving the request from val server nsce server retrieves the performance data of network slice from gs for oam system the apis defined in clause ts is utilized for cn functions the apis of nnwdafanalyticsinfo service defined in clause ts can be utilized the analytics data defined in clause to clause ts network slice instance related performance data defined in clause ts and network analytics data in clause and clause ts exposed by oam system may be acquired nsce server retrieves the alarms of network slice instances from oam system via the procedures defined in clause ts and the alarms are defined in clause ts eg the fault of communication environmental equipment processing error qos for deviceresourcefilefunctionalitysmallest nsce server may request the alarm information eg the gs network is not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the services problem collected by nsce client if possible the information collected by the nsce client depends on the thirdparties requirements and implementation nsce client report the requested fault information to nsce server nsce server correlates the applications services and the network resources of the specific network slice instances which supports the applications and services with the snssai nsi id nsinstanceid defined in ts application identifier defined in and then diagnoses the causes of the fault of the applications or services by analysing the fault information from different sources for example the ran function of the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application for a certain time duration the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by service availability failure events and in the ran function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time duration then the environment fault may be the root cause of the service availability failure and should be prioritized to be solved the fault may be identified with critical major minor ignore to show its prioritization nsce server response to val server with the reports of fault diagnostic result to indicate the causes of the failures of the applications or services if there is no problem within the gs network the val server may be requested to check the application layer itself again if the nsce server detects that the applicationservice error is caused by the gs the val server may send the fault diagnosis report to oam system to indicate the server fault which causes the applicationservice failure by utilizing the nsceoam interface note the apis utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to oam will reutilize the fault management services in ts exposed by egmf as defined in ts --- the request type in step indicates existing pdu session or existing emergency pdu session the smf determines that the request is due to switching between gpp access and nongpp access or due to handover from eps the smf identifies the existing pdu session based on the pdu session id in such a case the smf does not create a new sm context but instead updates the existing sm context and provides the representation of the updated sm context to the amf in the response if the request type is initial request and if the old pdu session id is included in nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext request the smf identifies the existing pdu session to be released based on the old pdu session id subscription data includes the allowed pdu session types allowed ssc modes default qi and arp subscribed sessionambr smfassociated external parameters ip index or static ip addressprefix may be included in the subscription data if the ue has subscribed to it the smf checks the validity of the ue request it checks whether the ue request is compliant with the user subscription and with local policies if the selected dnn corresponds to an ladn whether the ue is located within the ladn service area based on the ue presence in ladn service area indication from the amf if the amf does not provide the ue presence in ladn service area indication and the smf determines that the selected dnn corresponds to a ladn then the smf considers that the ue is out of the ladn service area the smf determines whether the pdu session requires redundancy and the smf determines the rsn as described in clause of ts if the smf determines that redundant handling is not allowed or not possible for the given pdu session the smf shall either reject the establishment of the pdu session or accept the establishment of a pdu session without redundancy handling based on local policy if the ue request is considered as not valid the smf decides to not accept to establish the pdu session note the smf can instead of the nudmsdmget service operation use the nudmsdmsubscribe service operation with an immediate report indication that triggers the udm to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the smf and the udm for a disaster roaming service the udm provides the session management subscription data to the smf based on the local policy andor the local configuration as specified in clause of ts for an snssai subject to nsac and if lbo applies the smf in supporting vplmn stores the applicable nsac admission mode from smf to amf either nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext response cause sm context id or n sm container pdu session reject cause or an nsmfpdusessionupdatesmcontext response depending on the request received in step if the smf received nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext request in step and the smf is able to process the pdu session establishment request the smf creates an sm context and responds to the amf by providing an sm context id if the up security policy for the pdu session is determined to have integrity protection set to required the smf may based on local configuration decide whether to accept or reject the pdu session request based on the ue integrity protection maximum data rate note the smf can eg be configured to reject a pdu session if the ue integrity protection maximum data rate has a very low value if the services provided by the dn would require higher bitrates when the smf decides to not accept to establish a pdu session the smf rejects the ue request via nas sm signalling including a relevant sm rejection cause by responding to the amf with nsmfpdusessioncreatesmcontext response the smf also indicates to the amf that the pdu session id is to be considered as released the smf proceeds to step and the pdu session establishment procedure is stopped optional secondary authenticationauthorization if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session the smf does not perform secondary authenticationauthorization if the request type received in step indicates emergency request or existing emergency pdu session the smf shall not perform secondary authenticationauthorization if the smf needs to perform secondary authenticationauthorization during the establishment of the pdu session by a dnaaa server as described in clause of ts the smf triggers the pdu session establishment authenticationauthorization as described in clause a if dynamic pcc is to be used for the pdu session the smf performs pcf selection as described in clause of ts if the request type indicates existing pdu session or existing emergency pdu session the smf shall use the pcf already selected for the pdu session otherwise the smf may apply local policy b the smf may perform an sm policy association establishment procedure as defined in clause to establish an sm policy association with the pcf and get the default pcc rules for the pdu session the smf shall include the gpp data off status if received in step the gpsi pvs fqdns andor pvs ip addresses and the onboarding indication shall be included if available at smf in the case of onsnpn the smf shall include both the snssai and the alternative snssai if received in step if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session the smf provides information on the policy control request trigger conditions that have been met by an smf initiated sm policy association modification procedure as defined in clause the pcf may provide policy information defined in clause and in ts to smf the ursp rule enforcement in step may be included if smf receives the ursp rule enforcement from ue as described in clause of ts the pcf for the ue subscribes to notifications of event ue reporting connection capabilities from associated ursp rule as defined in clause in ts using npcfpolicyauthorizationsubscribe eventid set to ue reporting connection capabilities from associated ursp rule eventfilter set to at least list of connection capabilities to the pcf for the pdu session the pcf for session may notify the pcf for ue about the ursp rule enforcement together with the pdu session parameters that this application associated with by npcfpolicyauthorizationnotify during the sm policy association establishment procedure if the pcf detects the request relates to sm policy association enabling integration with tsn or tsc or deterministic networking as defined in ts clause based on local configuration the pcf may provide policy control request trigger for gs bridgerouter information as defined in clause of ts the pcf based on the emergency dnn sets the arp of the pcc rules to a value that is reserved for emergency services as described in ts note the purpose of step is to receive pcc rules before selecting upf if pcc rules are not needed as input for upf selection step can be performed after step during the sm policy association establishment procedure for a nonroaming pdu session if a snssai is subject to network slice usage control the pcf may provide a slice usage policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a pdu session inactivity timer value as described in clause of ts if the request type in step indicates initial request the smf selects an ssc mode for the pdu session as described in clause of ts the smf also selects one or more upfs as needed as described in clause of ts in the case of pdu session type ipv or ipv or ipvv the smf allocates an ip addressprefix for the pdu session unless configured otherwise as described in clause of ts in the case of pdu session type ipv or ipvv the smf also allocates an interface identifier to the ue for the ue to build its linklocal address for unstructured pdu session type the smf may allocate an ipv prefix for the pdu session and n pointtopoint tunnelling based on udpipv as described in clause of ts for ethernet pdu session type neither a mac nor an ip address is allocated by the smf to the ue for this pdu session if the amf indicated control plane ciot gs optimisation in step for this pdu session then for unstructured pdu session type the smf checks whether ues subscription include a nef identity for nidd for the dnnsnssai combination when the nef identity for nidd is present in the ues subscription data the smf will select the nef identified for the snssai and selected dnn in the nef identity for nidd as the anchor of this pdu session otherwise the smf will select a upf as the anchor of this pdu session for other pdu session types the smf will perform upf selection to select a upf as the anchor of this pdu session if the request type in step is existing pdu session the smf maintains the same ip addressprefix that has already been allocated to the ue in the source network if the request type in step indicates existing pdu session referring to an existing pdu session moved between gpp access and nongpp access the smf maintains the ssc mode of the pdu session the current pdu session anchor and ip address note the smf may decide to trigger eg new intermediate upf insertion or allocation of a new upf as described in step in clause if the request type indicates emergency request the smf selects the upf as described in clause of ts and selects ssc mode smf may select a upf eg based on requested dnnsnssai that supports nwtt functionality smf may select a psa upf that supports pdu set identification and marking for a qos flow with pdu set based handling capability smf may perform an smf initiated sm policy association modification procedure as defined in clause to provide information on the policy control request trigger conditions that have been met if request type is initial request and dynamic pcc is deployed and pdu session type is ipv or ipv or ipvv smf notifies the pcf if the policy control request trigger condition is met with the allocated ue ip addressprefixes note if an ip addressprefix has been allocated before step eg subscribed static ip addressprefix in udmudr or the step is performed after step the ip addressprefix can be provided to pcf in step and the ip addressprefix notification in this step can be skipped pcf may provide updated policies to the smf the pcf may provide policy information defined in clause and in ts to smf the pcf for pdu session may generate pcc rule based on the ursp rule eg connection capability referring to the clause in ts note mapping between connection capability and sdf templates in the pcc rule is implementation specific if request type indicates initial request the smf initiates an n session establishment procedure with the selected upfs otherwise it initiates an n session modification procedure with the selected upfs a the smf sends an n session establishmentmodification request to the upf and provides packet detection enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the upf for this pdu session if the smf is configured to request ip address allocation from upf as described in clause of ts then the smf indicates to the upf to perform the ip addressprefix allocation and includes the information required for the upf to perform the allocation if the selective user plane deactivation is required for this pdu session the smf determines the inactivity timer and provides it to the upf for a pdu session for nonroaming subscribers if the snssai of the pdu session is subject to network slice usage control the smf obtains the pdu session inactivity timer value for the pdu session as described in step or step or uses preconfigured value and configures the upf to run the pdu session inactivity timer the smf provides trace requirements to the upf if it has received trace requirements if the reliable data service is enabled for the pdu session by the smf as specified in ts the rds configuration information --- the enumeration upconfidentiality indicates whether up confidentiality protection is required preferred or not

determine a target niwf that supports the subset of the requested nssai that is allowed by the subscribed snssais based on the list of supported tas and the corresponding list of supported slices for each ta obtained in n interface management procedures as specified in ts to determine the target niwf the amf may take into account ue location corresponding to last visited tai included in

interaction steps between the gateways and the pcrf in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway both the roaming figure and nonroaming figure scenarios are depicted in the figure in the roaming case the vpcrf acts as an intermediary sending the qos policy rules provision from the hpcrf in the hplmn to the trusted nongpp ip access in the vplmn the vpcrf receives the acknowledgment from the trusted nongpp ip access and forwards it to the hpcrf in the nonroaming case the vpcrf is not involved at all the trusted nongpp ip access receives an ipcan specific resource allocation or resource release request initiated by the ue the trusted nongpp ip access initiates the gateway control and qos policy rules request procedure as specified in ts the trusted nongpp ip access provides the ue request or release of resources as an event report the pcrf makes a pcc decision as a result of the gateway control and qos policy request and provides the updated qos rules to the trusted nongpp ip access an ipcan specific resource allocation or resource release procedure may be triggered by the enforcement of the received policy rules in this step a response for the resource requestrelease is sent to the ue the trusted nongpp ip access indicates to the pcrf whether the requested qos policy rules provision could be enforced or not and thus completing the gw control and qos rules provision procedure the pcrf initiates the policy and charging rules provision procedure as specified in ts to update the pcc rules in the pdn gw the updated pcc rules and event triggers include any adjustments to resources due to the decision taken in step note step may be performed in parallel with steps if acknowledgement of resource allocation is not required at the pcrf to update pcc rules in pcef for details please refer to ts step may be omitted if the trusted nongpp ip access has already received

have a g subscription that is known to be active in gc note the hss may be aware that a g subscription for the ue exists based on the core network type restrictions defined for the ue ie if restriction for core network type indicates that the ue can access to gc it implies that the ue has g subscription data additionally the hss may be aware that a ue for which g subscription data exist is not active in gc eg when the hss has not yet received an nhssuecm snderegistration request from the udm for that ue see clause step --- the complexity of operating a network increases with the number of supported subscribers and one contributor will be the management of allocating subscribers to the application servers for the same set of services where there is a requirement for a user to be assigned to an application servers longer than the duration of one session this would occur when there is data which is to be retained together with the processing resources longer than a single

cdrx change trigger condition in ran is met ran notifies amf of the occurrence of cdrx change and the updated cdrx parameters with the reception of the message in step amf considers the cdrx change pcrt condition is met amf initiates the am policy association modification procedure and notifies ampcf of the occurrence of cdrx change and the updated cdrx parameters ampcf further notifies xr af of the occurrence of cdrx change and the updated cdrx parameters ampcf may map the updated cdrx parameters to parameters that xr af can understand --- the nsce servers supports standalone deployment

analytics information on qos sustainability provided by the nwdaf the parameters included in the request are defined in clause of ts the nf can request statistics or predictions or both the consumer provides the tais or cell ids andor finer granularity area eg below cell via longitudelatitude range etc in location information when requesting qos sustainability analytics if the af doesnt provide tais or cell ids the nwdaf as an gc internal nf is expected to obtain such information ie to determine which cells are related to the finer granularity area the consumer may optionally provide ue context or subscription information such as one or more of the following device speed or speed range serving upf node information subscriber category as in ts clause device model device manufacturer imei or imeisv or tac range supported frequency bands equipment type a if the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested analytics the nwdaf decides the amfs based on the taiscell ids and obtains the ue list in the tascells from amf by invoking namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation using event id number of ues present in a geographical area as described in ts b the nwdaf invokes namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the update of the ue list using event id ue moving in or out of area of interest as described in ts the nwdaf initiates the lcs service request to the gmlclmf to get the location and optionally the speed of ues from ue list provided by the amf in step the gmlclmf initiates the ue location service procedure and gets the location of the ues the gmlclmf provides location information for each ue in the ue list to the nwdaf from the list of ue locations returned by the gmlclmf the nwdaf identifies the ues located in finer granularity area by comparing the ues locations to the finer granularity area provided in step the nwdaf invokes namfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the serving smf for the ue based on the serving smf in step the nwdaf invokes nsmfeventexposuresubscribe service operation to get the upf information for the ue the nwdaf may collect qos information either from the upf directly or subscribe to the upf via the smf the qos information may include the bandwidth packet delay for the ue and the information on the serving upf node id optionally the nwdaf may collect additional information for the ue context or ue subscription from the udm such as subscriber category pei if available pei may be used to retrieve from gsma database additional information such as device model device manufacturer imei or imeisv or tac range supported frequency bands equipment type such additional information may be used by nwdaf to add more information to the collected measurements and filter those measurements that are applicable to the ue and subscription context for which analytics are requested by the service consumer the nwdaf verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives the requested analytics the nwdaf can detect the need for notification based on comparing the requested analytics of the target qi against the reporting thresholds provided by the consumer in any cell over the requested analytics target period the nwdaf provides the response or notification on qos sustainability to the nf consumer note nwdaf may decide to ignore some of the filters if collected measurements are not sufficient to derive meaningful analytics in such scenario a warning message is provided in the response or notification to the nf consumer note in order to reduce the amount of information collected per measurement point the additional information from udm may only be collected for the events of gbr unfulfillment in this way the additional analytics filter information may only be supported for qi of resource type gbr and for events of gbr unfulfillment --- this solution addresses key issue --- in this scenario consider two separate gpp networks one gpp network with a satellite

policy requests from ue to af --- based on existing network selection procedure this solution defines a new list of hosting network that used for accessing to the target hosting network for the localized service when needed a list of hosting networks includes at least npn id optional valid time orand area information this list has highest priority for the ue to select when it is used or activated when the localized service in the hosting network is finished the list of hosting network is deactivated so that ue can perform normal network selection the following principle applies for the list of hosting network with highest priority when performing automatic network selection even higher than hplmn assumed that ue registered to one hosting network successfully for the expected localized service when ue moves into the coverage of hplmn based on existing logic of network selection ue has to select higher prioritized networkeg hplmn and then the localized service will be interrupted so the list of hosting network has higher priority than any other network for ue to perform network selection including even hplmn can be activated or deactivated by ue or home network eg when ue attempts to access the hosting network for the localized service or when the localized service is finished or home network sends the instruction to ue etc can be preconfigured or dynamic delivered by home network can be used for specific time orand specific area orand specific localized services editors note how to obtain the list of hosting networks is ffs --- this procedure is used

provisioning for scef based services are illustrated in clause --- intentdriven management solution tries to relieve the consumer of the management system from artificial complexity in the end the consumer of a management system is not interested in instances of ioc like networkslice which are concepts introduced to manage slices by classical configuration management instead the consumer of a management system wants to request mobile communication for ue without the need to know about details of the management system the management system needs to offer the flexibility as provided by the network architecture described in ts while at the same time any request needs to obey to the limitations of the architecture the following paragraphs give a brief summary of the basic concepts of qos and slicing which are the basis for intentdriven management of network slices the qos framework clause and network slicing clause are two independent key features of the gpp mobile network architecture according to ts one network slice identified by its snssai supports one or more pdu connectivity service pdu sessions ie services that provide exchange of pdus between a ue and a data network identified by a dnn each pdu connectivity service contains one or more qos flows which might be of different qos characteristics and which all terminate at the same dnn via the same upf each qos flow is associated to one requested qos profile and additionally might be associated to alternative qos profiles depending on the experienced network conditions the network can switch between these qos profiles on one hand this concept is the basis to use network slices as internal means for the network operator to partition the network in a way that qos flows of similar qos characteristics are grouped to pdu connectivity services that are tagged by the same snssai this specific combination of qos and network slicing results in that network slices as a whole might be optimized for certain traffic ie to optimize certain nf specifically for the assigned traffic and to assign these nf in nrf to the snssai an operator might prepare several of such network slices for traffic of different qos characteristics once a customer requests a pdu connectivity service that matches the qos characteristics of such prepared network slice the operator assigns the pdu connectivity services to the correspondingly optimized network slice on the other hand the concept offers the flexibility for csp and nop to offer to cscs a dedicated network slice as a product that carries all pdu connectivity services as the csc requires potentially towards different dnns eg local breakout in the tenants computing centre public voice to ims and towards public internet while each pdu connectivity service might carry multiple qos flows of different qos this flexibility enables the csc to request pdu connectivity services that are terminating at dnn as required by the csc eg breakout at local upf and that carry qos flows of specific qos characteristics depending on technical bordering conditions of the requested pdu connectivity services and by the business model of csp and nop csp or nop might use the snssai to group pdu connectivity services to network slices --- as specified in clause of gpp ts for home routed pdu sessions there is nas sm information that the vsmf and hsmf need to interpret and nas sm information that the vsmf only needs to transfer between the ue and hsmf but which it does not need to interpret nas sm information that only needs to be transferred between the ue and hsmf by the vsmf can be extended in later versions or releases of the nas specification eg defining new fields or values within existing ies and the extensions should not impact the vsmf besides in hr roaming scenarios the vsmf and hsmf can comply to different versions or releases of the nas specification it should be possible to support new sm features only requiring support from the hsmf without impacting the vsmf when the hsmf complies with a more recent release than the vsmf eg defining new nas sm ies in signalling from the ue to the hsmf andor signalling from the hsmf to the ue --- to support pdu set integrated packet handling with qos differentiation this solution proposes key principles the general architecture to support this is shown in figure three principles are adhered to pdu set qos treatment is determined by policy using dynamic or nondynamic pcc policy is enforced at the ran based on ngap signalling between the ran and smf user plane packet marking at the upf should indicate the characteristics of a given pdu not qos handling such as the priority to be provided to a pdu note that priority level is already a qos parameter sent via ngap rtp header extensions for scalable media streams are proposed by the ietf in draftietfavtextframemarking the header extension identifies the temporal and spatial media layers associated with a packet as well as dependencies of enhancement layer instances on base layer instances this allows layers to be selectively forwarded or otherwise handled in the network the solution adopted for this key issue should provide comparable capability for the gs in the gs a qos flow can carry multiple application flow instances of the same type eg two hx video streams as well as application flow instances of different types eg hx video ac audio haptic data to maintain this capability while providing perpdu set handling it must be possible to distinguish between these application media subflows within a qos flow one option for doing so is to consider the application mediastream subflow as a pdu set to which a pdu may belong and to identify it as such in the gtpu header figure gs support for pdu family integrated packet handling --- to procedures are presented as changes underlined text to clause of ts taken from approved s as follows the af can use the procedure to activate update or delete the g access stratum time distribution for one ue or a group of ues the af may query the status of the g access stratum time distribution using nnefastiget service operation the nnefasticreate and nnefastiupdate request may contain the parameters as described in table table description of g access stratum time distribution parameters figure management of g access stratum time information am policy association establishment as described in clause in ts when the procedure is triggered by the af request to influence the g access stratum time distribution to create a new request the af provides access stratum time distribution parameters to the nef using the nnefasticreate service operation together with the af identifier and potentially further inputs as specified in table including a target one ue identified by supi or gpsi a group of ues identified by an external group identifier the nef maps the external group identifier to an internal group identifier and any gpsi to a supi to update or remove an existing request the af invokes an nnefastiupdate or nnefastidelete service operation providing the corresponding time synchronization configuration id to query the status of the access stratum time distribution the af invokes nnefastiget service operation providing the target list of ue identities supi or gpsi the af that is part of operators trust domain may invoke the services directly with the tsctsf note steps and can occur in any order when the procedure is triggered by the af request to influence the g access stratum time distribution the nef authorizes the request after successful authorization the nef invokes the ntsctsfasticreateupdatedeleteget service operation with the tsctsf discovered and selected as described in clause of ts the tsctsf determines whether the targeted ue is part of a ptp instance in gs if so the tsctsf rejects the request steps are skipped when the procedure is triggered by ptp instance activation modification or deactivation in the tsctsf if time synchronization error budget is provided by the af the tsctsf may use the ptp port state of each dstt to determine an uu time synchronization error budget for corresponding supis that are part of the ptp instance if time synchronization error budget is provided by the af the tsctsf calculates the uu time synchronization error budget as described in clause of ts if frequency or phase accuracy compared to utc phase or frequency respectively has been provided the tsctsf calculates the uu accuracy value if the af request targets a group of ues the tsctsf uses the nudmsdmget request to retrieve the subscription information supi list from the udm using the internal group id the udm provides the nudmsdmget response containing a supi list that identifies ues that belong to that group of ues the tsctsf searches the pcf for the ue using nbsfmanagementsubscribe with a supi as an input parameter indicating that it is searching for the pcf that handles the am policy association of the ue the bsf provides to the tsctsf the identity of the pcf for the ue for the requested supi via an nbsfmanagementnotify operation if matching entries already existed in the bsf when step is performed this shall be immediately reported to the tsctsf the tsctsf sends to the pcf for the ue its request for the am policy of the ue identified by supi using npcfampolicyauthorization request containing the g access stratum time distribution indication enable disable and optionally the calculated uu time synchronization error budget and the timing resiliency parameters if provided including the uu frequency or phase accuracy if the pcf receives multiple time synchronization error budgets or frequencyphase accuracy for a given ue then the pcf picks the most stringent budget or frequencyphase accuracy the pcf takes a policy decision and then the pcf may initiate an am policy association modification procedure for the ue as described in clause of ts to provide amf the g access stratum time distribution parameters as part of this the amf shall if supported send the g access stratum time distribution indication enable disable and the uu time synchronization error budget and timing resiliency parameters when they are available to an ngran node using ngap procedures eg ue context setupmodification specified of ts the ngran node shall if supported store the information in the ue context based on this information the ngran node provides the gs access stratum timing to the ue according to the uu time synchronization error budget and timing resiliency parameters as provided by the tsctsf if supported by ue and ngran note this release of the specification assumes that deployments ensure that the targeted ues and the ngran nodes serving those ues support rel propagation delay compensation as defined in ts the pcf of the ue replies to the tsctsf with the result of npcfampolicyauthorization operation the tsctsf
